<h1 id="linux">Linux</h1>
<p>Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that is widely popular due to its flexibility, stability, and security features. As a Unix-based OS, Linux has a command-line interface, which allows users to perform various tasks through text commands. However, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can also be installed for ease of use.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>

<h2 id="security-best-practices-for-linux">Security Best Practices for Linux</h2>
<p>While Linux is inherently secure, there are best practices to enhance your system’s security further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your system updated: Regularly update your kernel, OS packages, and installed software to ensure you have the latest security patches.</li>
<li>Enable a firewall: Configure and enable a firewall, such as <code>iptables</code>, to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.</li>
<li>Use strong passwords and user accounts: Create separate accounts with strong passwords for different users and grant them only the required privileges.</li>
<li>Disable unused services: Unnecessary services can be potential security risks; ensure only required services are running on your system.</li>
<li>Implement a Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) policy: SELinux provides a mandatory access control (MAC) system that restricts user and process access to system resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding Linux’s features and best practices, you can leverage its powerful capabilities and robust security features to enhance your computing environment’s performance and safety.</p>
