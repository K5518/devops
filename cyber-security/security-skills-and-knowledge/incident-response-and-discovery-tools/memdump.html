<p>Memdump is a handy tool designed for forensic analysis of a system’s memory. The main purpose of Memdump is to extract valuable information from the RAM of a computer during a cyber security incident or investigation. By analyzing the memory dump, cyber security professionals can gain insights into the attacker’s methods, identify malicious processes, and uncover potential evidence for digital forensics purposes.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Dumping</strong>: Memdump allows you to create an image of the RAM of a computer, capturing the memory contents for later analysis.</li>
<li><strong>File Extraction</strong>: With Memdump, you can extract executable files or any other file types from the memory dump to investigate potential malware or data theft.</li>
<li><strong>String Analysis</strong>: Memdump can help you identify suspicious strings within the memory dump, which may provide crucial information about an ongoing attack or malware’s behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Memdump is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
