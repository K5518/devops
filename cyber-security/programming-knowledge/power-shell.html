<h1 id="power-shell">Power Shell</h1>
<p>PowerShell is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft primarily for the purpose of automating tasks and managing system configuration. PowerShell is designed specifically for Windows but has been made available for other platforms as well, such as macOS and Linux.</p>
<h2 id="why-powershell">Why PowerShell?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation:</strong> PowerShell scripts allow users to automate tasks, helping to save time and reduce the likelihood of introducing errors during manual processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command discovery:</strong> PowerShell’s built-in <code>Get-Command</code> cmdlet allows users to easily find and learn about the commands available to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consistency:</strong> The consistency of the PowerShell syntax makes it easy to learn and use the scripting language, allowing users to create complex scripts with minimal investment in time and effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> PowerShell is now available across various platforms, making it even more valuable to learn and implement in your daily work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>Here are some essential concepts to understand while working with PowerShell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cmdlet:</strong> A cmdlet is a lightweight command that performs a specific action, such as creating a new folder or listing the files in a directory. Cmdlets follow the ‘Verb-Noun’ syntax (e.g., <code>Get-Process</code>, <code>New-Item</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline:</strong> A pipeline is a method of passing the output of one cmdlet as input to another cmdlet. It’s represented using the ’|’ symbol. (e.g., <code>Get-Process | Stop-Process</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aliases:</strong> Aliases are alternate names for cmdlets, created to provide a more intuitive, shorthand way to call the original cmdlet (e.g., <code>ls</code> is an alias for <code>Get-ChildItem</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables in PowerShell use the <code>$</code> symbol for storing values. (e.g., <code>$myVariable = "Hello, World!"</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operators:</strong> PowerShell supports various operators, such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, etc., for performing calculations, comparisons, and transformations on variables and values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scripting:</strong> PowerShell scripts are saved as <code>.ps1</code> files and executed using command line or Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).</p>
</li>
</ul>
