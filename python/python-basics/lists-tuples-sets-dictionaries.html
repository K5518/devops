<p><strong>Lists:</strong> are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.</p>
<p><strong>Tuple:</strong> A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.</p>
<p><strong>Set:</strong> A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.</p>
<p><strong>Dictionary:</strong> In python, Dictionary is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 &#x26; prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.</p>
