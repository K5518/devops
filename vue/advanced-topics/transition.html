<p>Vue offers two built-in components that can help work with transitions and animations in response to changing state:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&#x3C;Transition></code> for applying animations when an element or component is entering and leaving the DOM. This is covered on this page.</li>
<li><code>&#x3C;TransitionGroup></code> for applying animations when an element or component is inserted into, removed from, or moved within a <code>v-for</code> list. This is covered in the next chapter.</li>
</ul>
