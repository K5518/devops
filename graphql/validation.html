<p>Validation in GraphQL refers to the process of checking whether a GraphQL query or mutation conforms to the rules and constraints defined in the GraphQL schema. This can include checking that the query or mutation includes the required fields, that the arguments passed to a field are of the correct type, and that the values passed to fields or arguments fall within the expected range.</p>
