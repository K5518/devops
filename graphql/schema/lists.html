<p>In GraphQL, a list is a type that represents an ordered collection of items. Lists are defined using square brackets, with the type of the items inside.</p>
<p>Lists are used to represent an array of items in a GraphQL schema, and can be used as the return type for a field in an object type. Lists can contain any type of items, including scalars and other objects, and can also be nested within other lists.</p>
