<p>GraphQL is a strongly typed language. Type System defines various data types that can be used in a GraphQL application. The type system helps to define the schema, which is a contract between client and server. The commonly used GraphQL data types are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalar</li>
<li>Object</li>
<li>Query</li>
<li>Mutation</li>
<li>Enum</li>
</ul>
