<p>In GraphQL, fields are the individual pieces of data that can be queried or modified. They represent the properties of the data being requested or modified, and are the building blocks of queries and mutations.</p>
<p>Fields are defined in the GraphQL schema, which is a blueprint of the data that can be queried and modified. The schema defines the types of data that can be queried, and the fields that are available for each type.</p>
