<p>In GraphQL, live queries, also known as “real-time queries” or “subscriptions to queries”, is a way to push real-time updates to the client, when the data that is being queried changes on the server. It allows the client to subscribe to a specific query and receive updates in real-time as soon as the data changes.</p>
<p>With live queries, the client can subscribe to a specific query and receive updates when the data that is being queried changes on the server. The client can also specify the fields and arguments of the query, and the server will only send updates for the fields that the client has requested.</p>
