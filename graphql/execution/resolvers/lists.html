<h1 id="lists">Lists</h1>
<p>In GraphQL, a list is a type that represents an ordered collection of items. Lists can be used as the return type for a field in a query or mutation, and can contain any type of items, including scalars and objects.</p>
<p>The resolver function for a list field can retrieve the data from a database or a third-party API and return it as an array.</p>
