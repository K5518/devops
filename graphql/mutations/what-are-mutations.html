<p>In GraphQL, a mutation is a type of query used to make changes to data on the server. It is used to create, update, or delete data, and is structured similarly to a query, but with a “mutation” field at the top level instead of a “query” field.</p>
<p>A mutation typically includes fields that specify the data to be changed and the operation to be performed (e.g. “create”, “update”, or “delete”). It can also include arguments to specify the specific data to be affected.</p>
