<p>Before you start learning React Native, you should have a basic knowledge of <a href="/javascript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="/react">React</a>. You don’t need to fully master these topics, but you should be familiar with them. Learn the basics of JavaScript (e.g. topics marked for beginners in <a href="/javascript">JavaScript Roadmap</a> and continue with React Native. I have heard good things about official React Native documentation, so you can start there and pick up the relevant topics wherever needed.</p>
