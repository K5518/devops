<h1 id="react-native-testing-library">React Native Testing Library</h1>
<p>React Native Testing Library (RNTL) is a collection of tools and utilities to test React Native components. It is built on top of the Testing Library ecosystem, designed to work seamlessly with Jest and other testing frameworks. Its primary goal is to enable efficient and effective testing by providing simple and intuitive APIs that promote best practices, like testing UI components in isolation and promoting accessibility checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>It encourages testing from a user’s perspective, focusing on interaction and accessibility rather than component implementation details.</li>
<li>Built-in support for React Native’s asynchronous APIs like <code>act</code> and <code>flushMicrotasksQueue</code>.</li>
<li>Provides utility methods to query, fire events, and wait for elements in the components tree.</li>
</ul>
