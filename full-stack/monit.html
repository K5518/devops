<p>When it comes to monitoring the health of your applications, there are several different options available. My favorite monitoring stack is Prometheus and Grafana, but it can be a bit overwhelming to set up and configure. If you’re looking for a simpler solution, <strong>Monit</strong> is a great alternative that can be utilized to monitor and manage system resources such as services, processes, files, directories, devices, and network connections, making your application more reliable and resilient to issues like crashes, unresponsiveness, or resource exhaustion.</p>
<p>Some of the key features of Monit are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic Recovery:</strong> Monit can automatically restart a service or process if it fails, making your application more resistant to unexpected issues.</li>
<li><strong>Alert Notifications:</strong> Monit can send email notifications when a problem is detected or when a certain condition is met, keeping you informed about the health of your application.</li>
<li><strong>Event Logging:</strong> All events detected by Monit are stored in a log for easy troubleshooting and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Limit Monitoring:</strong> Monit can monitor the resource utilization (CPU, memory, network, etc.) of a process or service and take action if a specific limit is exceeded.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Configuration:</strong> Monit uses a simple, human-readable configuration syntax that allows you to tailor its behavior to your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Web Interface:</strong> Monit provides a built-in web interface for remotely monitoring your application’s status and manage services.</li>
</ul>
