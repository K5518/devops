<p>Caching ensures that the resources downloaded once are reused instead of doing a fresh fetch again. It is useful for increasing subsequent page load speed by reusing cached images, fonts, and other static assets. Caching should not be typically done on dynamic content. For example list of posts or comments. As part of the testing strategy, both caching and cache invalidation (not getting stale dynamic content) needs to be tested.</p>
