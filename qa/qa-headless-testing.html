<p>Headless testing is when end-to-end tests are performed without loading the browser’s user interface. Since the browser operates as a typical browser would but does not make use of the user interface, it is considered highly suitable for automated testing.</p>
<p>A few example cases where one may use headless browser testing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automating HTML event responses, such as form submission, keyboard events, mouse-clicking, etc.</li>
<li>Web scraping</li>
<li>Generating screenshots of webpages</li>
</ul>
