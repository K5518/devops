<p>Continuous Integration is a software development method where team members integrate their work at least once daily. An automated build checks every integration to detect errors in this method. In Continuous Integration, the software is built and tested immediately after a code commit. In a large project with many developers, commits are made many times during the day. With each commit, code is built and tested.</p>
<p>Continuous Delivery is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time. The main aim of continuous delivery is to build, test, and release software with good speed and frequency. It helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for frequent updates in production.</p>
