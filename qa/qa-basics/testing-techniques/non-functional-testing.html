<p>Non-functional testing is a type of software testing to test non-functional parameters such as reliability, load test, performance, and accountability of the software. The primary purpose of non-functional testing is to test the reading speed of the software system as per non-functional parameters. The parameters of non-functional testing are never tested before the functional testing.</p>
