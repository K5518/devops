<p>Test approach has two techniques:
Proactive - An approach in which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to find and fix the defects before the build is created.
Reactive - An approach in which the testing is not started until after design and coding are completed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Black Box Testing</li>
