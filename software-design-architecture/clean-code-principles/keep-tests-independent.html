<p>Keeping tests independent helps ensures that the tests are reliable, repeatable, and easy to maintain. When tests are independent, a change in one test will not affect the results of other tests.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to keep tests independent in system architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use dependency injection to decouple the test code from the application code. This allows the tests to be run without the need to instantiate the application objects directly.</li>
<li>Use mocks or stubs to isolate the test from external dependencies such as databases, APIs, or other services.</li>
<li>Use test data that is self-contained and does not rely on external data or state.</li>
<li>Use a test framework that supports running tests in parallel, so that the tests can be run independently of each other.</li>
<li>Use test-driven development (TDD), which involves writing tests before writing the application code. This ensures that the tests are independent and that the code is written with testability in mind.</li>
<li>Avoid global state and shared mutable state as it may cause unexpected results.</li>
</ul>
