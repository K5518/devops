<p>A layered architecture is a software design pattern in which the functionality of a system is divided into a set of layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility and interacting with the layers above and below it. The main idea behind a layered architecture is to separate the concerns of the system into distinct and independent layers, making the code more modular, easier to understand, test, and modify.</p>
<p>There are several types of layered architectures, but a common one is the three-layer architecture which consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation Layer</li>
<li>Business Layer</li>
<li>Data Access Layer</li>
</ul>
