<h1 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h1>
<p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), an interface is a contract or a set of methods that a class must implement. It defines a common set of methods that a class must provide, but it does not provide any implementation details. An interface can include both method signatures and constants.</p>
<p>Interfaces are used to define a common behavior for a group of related classes, and to provide a way for objects of different classes to be treated polymorphically. A class that implements an interface must provide an implementation for all of the methods declared in the interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only inherit from one base class.</p>
