<p>There are many software design principles that aim to guide the development of software in a way that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Some of the most common design principles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SOLID principles (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle)</li>
<li>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)</li>
<li>YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)</li>
<li>KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</li>
<li>LoD (Law of Demeter)</li>
<li>Composition over Inheritance</li>
<li>Encapsulate What Varies</li>
<li>Hollywood Principle</li>
<li>Program Against Abstractions</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these design principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs.</p>
