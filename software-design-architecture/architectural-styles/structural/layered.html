<h1 id="layered">Layered</h1>
<p>In software architecture, layered architecture is a design approach in which a software system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces. This approach allows for a more modular and flexible design, where each layer can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, making it easier to add new features, modify existing ones, and maintain the system.</p>
<p>A layered architecture is often used for large and complex systems, where the need for scalability and flexibility is high. Each layer in a layered architecture is responsible for a specific functionality and can be thought of as a “black box” with a well-defined interface. The layers communicate with each other through these interfaces, allowing for a clear separation of concerns.</p>
