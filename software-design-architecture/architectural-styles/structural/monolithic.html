<h1 id="monolithic">Monolithic</h1>
<p>In software architecture, monolithic architecture is a design approach in which a software system is built as a single, integrated, and self-contained unit. In a monolithic architecture, all the components of the system are tightly coupled and depend on each other. This means that changes in one part of the system may affect other parts of the system.</p>
<p>A monolithic architecture is often used for small to medium-sized systems, where the complexity of the system is manageable and the need for scalability and flexibility is not as high. In a monolithic architecture, the entire system is typically built, deployed, and executed as a single unit, which can make it easier to understand and manage the system.</p>
