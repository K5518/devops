<p>Messaging is a key concept in several architectural styles, including event-driven architecture (EDA), microservices, and message-driven architecture (MDA).</p>
<ul>
<li>Event-driven architecture (EDA)</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Message-driven architecture (MDA)</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, messaging is a powerful concept that allows for the decoupling and scalability of systems and it’s used in different architectural styles to improve the flexibility and scalability of the system by allowing for loose coupling between components and making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.</p>
