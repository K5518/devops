<p>The Hollywood Principle is a software development principle that states: “Don’t call us, we’ll call you.” It suggests that high-level components should dictate the flow of control in an application, rather than low-level components.</p>
<p>This principle is often used in the context of inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injection. In traditional software development, low-level components are responsible for creating and managing the high-level components that they depend on. With IoC, the high-level components dictate the flow of control, and the low-level components are created and managed by a separate mechanism.</p>
