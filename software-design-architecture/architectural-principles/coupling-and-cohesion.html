<p>Coupling and cohesion are two principles in software architecture that are used to measure the degree of interdependence between components in a system.</p>
<p>Coupling refers to the degree to which one component depends on another component. High coupling means that a change in one component will likely affect other components, making the system more difficult to understand, test, and maintain. Low coupling, on the other hand, means that changes to one component have minimal impact on other components, making the system more modular and easier to understand, test, and maintain.</p>
<p>Cohesion, on the other hand, refers to the degree to which the responsibilities of a component are related to each other. High cohesion means that a component has a single, well-defined purpose and that all its functionality and data is related to that purpose. Low cohesion, on the other hand, means that a component has multiple, unrelated responsibilities, making it more difficult to understand, test, and maintain.</p>
