<p>Component principles in software architecture refer to guidelines for designing and implementing software components that are modular, reusable, and easy to understand, test, and maintain. Some of the key component principles in software architecture include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High cohesion</li>
<li>Low coupling</li>
<li>Separation of concerns</li>
<li>Interface-based design</li>
<li>Reusability</li>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>Modularity</li>
<li>Interoperability</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these component principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs. It also enables better code reuse, and makes it easier to test and change the code, and also enables better code reuse, as components can be reused in different contexts.</p>
