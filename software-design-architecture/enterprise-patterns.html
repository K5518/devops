<p>Enterprise patterns are a set of design patterns that are commonly used in the development of enterprise software applications. These patterns provide a common vocabulary and a set of best practices for solving common problems that arise in the development of large, complex software systems. Some examples of enterprise patterns include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</li>
<li>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</li>
<li>Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</li>
<li>Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)</li>
</ul>
<p>These patterns can help to improve the maintainability and scalability of the software, by providing a clear separation of concerns and allowing for a more modular and flexible architecture.</p>
