<p>Spring Cloud is a collection of libraries and tools for building cloud-native applications using the Spring Framework. It provides a set of abstractions and implementations for common patterns and best practices used in cloud-based applications, such as service discovery, configuration management, and circuit breaker patterns, among others.</p>
<p>Spring Cloud is built on top of Spring Boot and Spring Framework, and it integrates with other Spring projects, as well as with popular open-source libraries and cloud-native technologies, such as Netflix Eureka, Ribbon, Hystrix, and OpenFeign.</p>
<p>Spring Cloud provides several libraries and tools that developers can use to build cloud-native applications with microservices architecture, like :</p>
<ul>
<li>Spring Cloud Config, for managing configuration properties</li>
<li>Spring Cloud Netflix, for integration with Netflix OSS libraries</li>
<li>Spring Cloud Sleuth, for distributed tracing</li>
<li>Spring Cloud OpenFeign, for declarative REST clients</li>
<li>Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, for implementing the Circuit Breaker pattern</li>
<li>Spring Cloud Eureka, for service discovery</li>
<li>Spring Cloud Zuul for API Gateway implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using Spring Cloud, developers can take advantage of the features and capabilities provided by the cloud-native technologies, while still being able to use the familiar Spring programming model and development tools. It helps developers to use cloud-native patterns and best practices in a consistent and easy-to-use way, allowing them to focus on business logic, while the Spring Cloud libraries handle the infrastructure-related aspects of building cloud-native applications.</p>
