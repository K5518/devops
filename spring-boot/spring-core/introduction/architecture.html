<p>Spring Boot follows a layered architecture in which each layer communicates with the layer directly below or above (hierarchical structure) it. There are four layers in Spring Boot are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: handles the HTTP requests, translates the JSON parameter to object, and authenticates the request and transfer it to the business layer.</li>
<li><strong>Business Layer</strong>: The business layer handles all the business logic. It consists of service classes and uses services provided by data access layers. It also performs authorization and validation.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence Layer</strong>: The persistence layer contains all the storage logic and translates business objects from and to database rows.</li>
<li><strong>Database Layer</strong>: In the database layer, CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations are performed.</li>
</ul>
