<h1 id="spring-mvc">Spring MVC</h1>
<p>Spring MVC is a framework for building web applications in Java. It is part of the Spring Framework, which is a larger ecosystem of tools for building Java applications. Spring MVC is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which helps to separate the concerns of the application into three distinct components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.</p>
<p>Spring MVC provides a powerful and flexible way to build web applications, and it integrates well with other parts of the Spring ecosystem, such as Spring Security for authentication and authorization, and Spring Data for data access.</p>
