<p>Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a feature of the Spring Framework that allows developers to define certain behaviors (i.e., “aspects”) that cut across multiple classes, such as logging or transaction management. These behaviors, which are called “advices,” can be applied to specific “join points” (i.e., points in the execution of a program) in the application, using “pointcuts” to determine where the advices should be applied.</p>
<p>Spring AOP allows developers to separate the implementation of these cross-cutting concerns from the business logic of the application, making the code more modular and easier to understand. This can also make the application more flexible, since the same advices can be applied to different parts of the code without having to duplicate the code for the advices themselves.</p>
