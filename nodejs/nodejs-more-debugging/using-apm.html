<p>As much fun as it is to intercept your container requests with inspect and step through your code, you won’t have this option in production. This is why it makes a lot of sense to try and debug your application locally in the same way as you would in production.</p>
<p>In production, one of your tools would be to login to your remote server to view the console logs, just as you would on local. But this can be a tedious approach. Luckily, there are tools out there that perform what is called log aggregation, such as Stackify.</p>
<p>These tools send your logs from your running application into a single location. They often come with high-powered search and query utilities so that you can easily parse your logs and visualize them.</p>
