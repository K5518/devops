# Dependency injection

Dependency injection (DI) is a software design pattern that allows an object to receive its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. This can help to decouple the object from its dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain.

In the .NET ecosystem, there are several DI libraries available to help with implementing DI in your application. These libraries provide a way to define and configure dependencies, as well as a mechanism for injecting them into the objects that depend on them.

Here are a few links to learn more about dependency injection in .NET:

[Dependency Injection in .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/dependency-injection)  - This Microsoft documentation page provides an overview of DI in .NET, including an explanation of the benefits and common patterns for using DI.

[Dependency Injection with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1) - This tutorial shows how to use DI in ASP.NET Core applications, including how to register dependencies and how to inject them into controllers and other types.
