# Code Editors

Code editors are programs specifically designed for editing, managing and writing source code. They offer a wide range of features that make the development process easier and faster. Here's a brief introduction to some of the most popular code editors for C++:

- **Code::Blocks**: a free, open-source cross-platform IDE that supports multiple compilers including GCC, Clang and Visual C++. It is developed in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Visual Studio Code is a popular, free, open-source, and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for C++, along with an extensive library of extensions and plugins.

- **Visual Studio Community**: A free, open source, fully featured, and extensible IDE for individual developers to create applications for Android, iOS, Windows, and the web.

- **Sublime Text**: Sublime Text is a cross-platform text editor that is quite popular among developers due to its speed and minimalist design. It supports C++ with the help of plugins and has a variety of themes and packages available for customization.

- **CLion**: CLion is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains specifically for C and C++ developers. It provides advanced features like code completion, refactoring support, debugging, and more.

To work with C++ in your chosen code editor, you often need to install some additional tools and add-ons, such as compilers, linters, and debugger support. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the editor's documentation to set up C++ correctly.
