# Publishing Tools

When discussing the realm of tooling in technical writing, publishing plays a significant role. It involves the final process of making the documentation accessible to users. There are various tools used for publishing: 
- Adobe FrameMaker
- MadCap Flare
- Jekyll, etc

Which support different formats like PDF, HTML, ePubs, etc. 

They could also include version control, collaboration, and content reuse features. This not only makes the content accessible to the users but also ensures that the documentation is kept consistent and up-to-date.
