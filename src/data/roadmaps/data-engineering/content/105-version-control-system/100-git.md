# Understanding Git: A Beginner's Guide

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a powerful tool in the arsenal of coders. It's a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your project, collaborate with others, and revert to earlier versions of your work if needed.

Git is open-source and free, making it accessible for everyone. It's designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency. This makes it a popular choice for both individual developers and large corporations.
