# Orthonomalisation Resources

An orthonormalisation resource is any material or source of information that provides guidance or instruction on the process of orthonormalisation, which is a mathematical technique used to transform a set of vectors into a set of orthonormal vectors. Orthonormalisation resources can take various forms, including textbooks, online courses, video lectures, blogs, and academic papers. These resources typically cover topics such as orthonormal basis, orthogonal vectors and subspaces, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation, and QR decomposition. The goal of an orthonormalisation resource is to provide learners with a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical theory behind orthonormalisation and the practical applications of this technique in various fields of study, including signal processing, quantum mechanics, and computer graphics.
