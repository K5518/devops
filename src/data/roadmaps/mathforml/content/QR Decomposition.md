# QR Decomposition
QR Decomposition is a mathematical procedure that decomposes a matrix into the product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix.
It is also known as a way to factorize a matrix into two simpler matrices.
It is mostly used in linera algebra, numerical analysis, and optimization.
