# Gaussian

 Gaussian refers to a type of probability distribution called the Gaussian distribution, 
 which is also known as the normal distribution. This distribution is used to model continuous random variables whose values are distributed symmetrically around the mean,with most values clustering near the mean and fewer values occurring farther away from the mean.

The Gaussian distribution has a wide range of applications in fields such as physics,engineering, statistics, and finance.It is particularly useful for modeling measurements that have a natural random variation, such as measurement errors or noise in a signal.
