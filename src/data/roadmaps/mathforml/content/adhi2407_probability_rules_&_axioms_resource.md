# PROBABILITY & AXIOMS
# Define Probability
1.   Probability means possibility. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of a random event. 
2.  The value is expressed from zero to one. Probability has been introduced in Maths to predict how likely events are to happen. 
3.   The meaning of probability is basically the extent to which something is likely to happen. 
4.   This is the basic probability theory, which is also used in the probability distribution, where you will learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment


# What is an axiom?

1.  An axiom is a rule or statement that is generally accepted to be true without proof. An axiom is also called a postulate.
2.   Here is an axiom of addition and multiplication.
3.  Let x and y be real numbers.
4.  Then x + y is also a real number and xy is also a real number.
