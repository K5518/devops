# Vector Values Functions

A vector is a mathematical object that represents a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. In other words, a vector is a directed line segment that can be used to describe physical quantities such as velocity, force, acceleration, and displacement.
In machine learning, a vector-valued function is a function that maps an input vector to an output vector. This type of function is often used in tasks such as regression, where the goal is to predict a set of continuous values, or in multi-class classification, where the goal is to predict a set of probabilities over a set of possible classes.
