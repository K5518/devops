# Gosh

Gosh is a development platform that is purpose-built for securing the software supply chain and extracting the value locked in projects. It is the first blockchain-based platform for software development, which allows developers and businesses to create products in a familiar, straightforward, and safe way.

On Gosh, every operation, commit, and transaction is trustless, traceable, and transparent. This means that developers can build composable, censorship-resistant repositories, and monetize their open source projects by turning them into a DAO.

Gosh is built on cryptography, decentralization, and consensus, which means that repositories have no owner and are managed in a decentralized way. Developers can use Gosh like they use Git and turn any Gosh repository into a DAO and configure it to suit their needs. They can also fund their DAO and use DeFi applications to incentivize code security.

With Gosh, builds are no longer at risk. From source code on Gosh to Docker container, developers can be sure that their build is safe. Mission-critical applications can also write their scripts as formally verified smart contracts to get rid of holes in the CI/CD process.
