# Venom

The Venom Foundation is the first crypto foundation licensed in UAE's ADGM and is set to launch its blockchain platform soon. The platform uses asynchronous blockchain technology of dynamical sharding, which enables boundless scalability, higher security guarantees with decentralization, and manages the gross data transaction flows without faltering by increasing fees and transaction times. The foundation aims to develop and support a self-sufficient blockchain ecosystem with non-custodial wallet options, transparent transaction histories, interchain transactions, staking on validator nodes, and a native decentralized exchange, among others.

The MENA region entrepreneurs are considered pioneers in global crypto trend adoption, and the foundation's customizable approach is well-suited to bridging different dimensions of market participants. The platform has a panel of industry leaders and seasoned investors, and the project is generating attention in MENA due to its transactional management possibilities, higher security, and inbound governmental database projects. The foundation will work with ecosystem participants to offer new products such as NFT marketplace, derivative exchange, fiat-backed stablecoin, and others to come with the potential to become a bridge towards wide adoption of CBDC in the UAE, other MENA countries and globally.
