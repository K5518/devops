# Application Level Architecture

Application Level Architecture refers to the high-level design and organization of a software application. It involves making key decisions about the overall structure, components, modules, and their interactions within an application. This architectural layer focuses on providing a blueprint for the entire application, ensuring that it meets functional and non-functional requirements while being scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to change.

Examples:

### Monolithic Architecture:

A single, self-contained application where all components are tightly integrated into a single codebase.
Example: Traditional Content Management Systems (CMS) where the frontend, backend, and database are part of a single application.

### Microservices Architecture:

Decomposing an application into small, independent services that communicate over a network.
Example: An e-commerce platform where separate services handle user authentication, inventory management, order processing, etc.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):

Organizing an application as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate via standardized protocols.
Example: An enterprise system where different services handle specific business processes like HR, finance, and customer relationship management.

### Event-Driven Architecture:

Building an application where the flow of information is determined by events such as user actions, system events, or messages from other services.
Example: A real-time analytics dashboard that updates based on events like user interactions or data updates.

### Serverless Architecture:

Designing an application by utilizing cloud services for executing functions without managing the underlying infrastructure.
Example: Building a serverless API using cloud functions for handling specific tasks like image processing or data validation.

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):

Structuring an application around the hexagonal metaphor with inner layers representing application core and external layers representing input/output adapters.
Example: A banking application where the core business logic is isolated from the UI and database, allowing flexibility in adapting to different interfaces.

### Event Sourcing and CQRS:

Storing changes to the state of an application as a sequence of events, and separating read and write operations.
Example: A financial system where events represent transactions and separate read models are used for reporting.
In a software architect's roadmap, choosing the appropriate application level architecture involves evaluating factors such as scalability, maintainability, performance, and aligning with business goals. It's crucial to understand the specific needs of the application and its users before making architectural decisions.
