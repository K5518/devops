# Integration Testing

Integration testing is a broad category of tests where multiple software modules are __integrated__ and tested as a group. It is meant to test the __interaction__ between multiple services, resources, or modules. For example, an API's interaction with a backend service, or a service with a database. The goal of integration testing is to identify any defects or issues that may arise due to the integration of individual units. This type of testing can be conducted at various levels of the software development process, including unit, system, and acceptance testing.

## Types of Integration Testing

Integration testing can be broadly classified into two categories:
* **Top-down integration testing** : In this approach, the higher-level modules or components are tested first, followed by the lower-level modules.
* **Bottom-up integration testing** : This approach begins with testing the lower-level modules first and gradually integrating higher-level modules.
Another approach to integration testing is the sandwich testing approach. In this approach, the highest and lowest modules are tested first, followed by the intermediate modules. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex applications that have multiple layers of integration.

## Techniques for Integration Testing

Integration testing can be conducted using various techniques, including:

* **Black-box testing** : This involves testing the system from the end-user's perspective without any knowledge of the internal workings of the system.
* **White-box testing** : This involves testing the system's internal logic, code, and structure.
* **Gray-box testing** : This is a combination of both black-box and white-box testing and is used when partial knowledge of the system is available.
