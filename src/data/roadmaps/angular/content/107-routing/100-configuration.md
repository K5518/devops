# Configuration
In Angular, routing configuration is the process of defining your application's routes and how they relate to your application's components. Routing allows you to navigate between different views or pages of your application based on the browser URL.

<p><strong>Define Routes: </strong><br />
First, you need to define the routes of your application in a specific module (usually the AppRoutingModule). Routes are defined as an array of route configuration objects, where each object specifies a route and the component to load when that route is activated.</p>

<p><strong>Configure Routes:</strong><br /> Each route configuration object has properties like path for the route URL, component for the component to load when the route is activated, redirectTo to redirect to another route, children to define nested routes, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Define Base Path: </strong><br />You must define the base path of the application in the index.html file using the 
&lt;base href="/"&gt; tag. This base path is used as a prefix for all relative routes within your application.</p>

<p><strong>Add Router to Root Module: </strong><br />Import the RouterModule module and call the forRoot() method to configure the root router in your root module (usually the AppModule). This step provides the router access to the route configuration defined in your application.</p>

<p><strong>Add router-outlet Directive: </strong><br />In the template of the main component of your application (usually the AppComponent), add the router-outlet directive. This directive is used to indicate where the components corresponding to the active routes should be dynamically loaded.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation Between Routes: </strong><br /> To navigate between routes in your application, you can use the Router service provided by Angular. You can navigate imperatively using methods like navigate() or navigateByUrl(), or declaratively using directives like routerLink in your HTML links. </p>


In summary, configuring routing in Angular involves defining the routes of your application, setting up the router, defining the base path, and navigating between routes using the router. This allows you to create web applications with multiple views and a smooth, dynamic user experience.
