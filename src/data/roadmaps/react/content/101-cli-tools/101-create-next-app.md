# Create Next App (Recommended)

Create React App was the CLI based tool to start building a new single-page application in React.

It set up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provided a nice developer experience, and optimized your app for production.

But as of now, **the React team no longer recommends using create-react-app** as a bundler to create a new React application. 

The team and community realized that even though CRA was a jump-starter, it lacked the flexibility needed to configure or manage large and complex applications.

Nowadays, **the team recommends using production-grade React frameworks like Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, or Expo for native apps.**

To create a new React project using Next.js you just need to go to your terminal and type 'npx create-next-app@latest'

Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 18.0.0.
