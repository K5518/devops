# Instance Types

AWS EC2 instances come in a variety of types optimized to fit different use cases. They are grouped into categories depending on their performance capacity and pricing structure. There are five categories of instance types including:
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory/ Storage Optimized
- Accelerated Computing
- HPC Optimized

Each category is suited best for specific workloads and they consist of different instance types each given a specific name, for example, _'t2.micro'_. Each instance type has a specific amount of CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity. Understanding the workloads of your applications can help you determine which instance type would be best suited to your needs.
