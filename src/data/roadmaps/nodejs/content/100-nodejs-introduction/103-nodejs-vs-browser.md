# Nodejs vs Browser
The primary distinction between Node.js and browser-based JavaScript revolves around their execution environments and available APIs.

Execution Environments:
Browser: JavaScript in the browser primarily interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate webpage elements, handle events, and manage user interactions. It operates within the constraints and security limitations imposed by the browser environment.
Node.js: Contrarily, Node.js executes JavaScript on the server-side. It provides access to functionalities outside the browser, like file system operations, networking, and access to the operating system. Node.js uses the CommonJS module system for organizing code.
APIs and Modules:
Browser: It offers APIs like document, window, and fetch for DOM manipulation, event handling, and making HTTP requests.
Node.js: Provides APIs for file system operations, networking (with http and https modules), and access to OS-related functionalities. It uses the require function to import modules and uses the fs module for file system operations.
Module Systems:
Browser: Historically, browsers relied on script tags and newer standards like ECMAScript modules (import and export).
Node.js: Uses CommonJS (require and module.exports) but also supports ECMAScript modules with .mjs extension.
Global Objects:
Browser: In the browser, the global object is window, which represents the browser window.
Node.js: The global object in Node.js is global, providing access to Node.js-specific functionalities.
Additional Considerations:
Asynchronous Operations: Node.js heavily relies on asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations, utilizing callbacks, Promises, and async/await.
Package Management: Node.js uses npm or Yarn for package management, allowing developers to easily install, manage, and share dependencies for their projects.
Deployment: Browser-based JavaScript requires packaging files for browsers, whereas Node.js applications are typically deployed as server-side applications.
The differences in environments and available APIs significantly influence how developers architect and develop applications for these platforms.

Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language. Building apps that run in the browser is entirely different than building a Node.js application. Even though it's always JavaScript, some key differences make the experience radically different.
