# Printing output
Printing output in Node.js command-line applications is a fundamental aspect of communicating with users and displaying information. Here's how you can print output in Node.js command-line apps:

- **process.stdout**: This is a writable stream used for printing normal program output.
- **process.stderr**: This is a writable stream used for printing error messages and warnings.
- **Chalk**: Chalk is a popular package for styling and adding colors to terminal output. It provides a simple and expressive API for applying styles to strings.
- **Figlet**: Figlet allows you to create ASCII art from text. It's useful for creating stylized text headings or banners in terminal applications.
- **cli-progress**: cli-progress is a simple and flexible progress bar package for Node.js command-line applications. It provides options for customizing the appearance and behavior of progress bars.

Here's a simple example of using **process.stdout** and **process.stderr**:

```
process.stdout.write('This is standard output\n');
```

```
process.stderr.write('This is an error message\n');
```
