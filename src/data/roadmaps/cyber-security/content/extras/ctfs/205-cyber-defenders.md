# CyberDefenders

[CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/) is an online platform designed for individuals keen on enhancing their defensive and analytical skills in cybersecurity. It stands apart by focusing on blue team activities, as opposed to penetration testing, by providing exercises and labs in areas such as digital forensics, incident response, malware analysis, and threat intelligence. The platform curates a series of labs that replicate real-world cybersecurity scenarios and threats.

## Features of CyberDefenders

## Participation Process

- **Explore Labs:** Users have the opportunity to explore a wide array of labs after joining the platform. These labs are organized by their level of difficulty and thematic focus, enabling participants to select those that best match their skills and interests.

- **Engage with Labs:** Participants choose labs to work on, each aimed at teaching and testing specific cybersecurity skills. Objectives guide users through the processes of detection, analysis, and resolution of cyber threats.

- **Submit Solutions and Earn Badges:** Upon completing a lab, participants submit their solutions to earn points and badges. These accomplishments are important for their representation on the leaderboard, highlighting their expertise and activity on the platform.

- **Learn and Share:** After a lab is retired (no longer contributing to leaderboard points), users are encouraged to create and share their walkthroughs. This practice allows individuals to document their approaches to solving the lab, facilitating knowledge sharing within the community and ensuring that insights into solving the labs remain accessible without compromising the integrity of active labs.
