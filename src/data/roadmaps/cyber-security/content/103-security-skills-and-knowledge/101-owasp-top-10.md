# Web Based Attacks and OWASP 10

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization focused on improving the security of software. One of their most well-known projects is the **OWASP Top 10**, which is a list of the most critical web application security risks. The Top 10 project aims to raise awareness and provide businesses, developers, and security teams with guidance on how to address these risks effectively.

The OWASP Top 10 is updated periodically, with the most recent version released in 2023. Here is a brief summary of the current top 10 security risks:

- **Broken Access Control**: Flaws related to enforcing access controls allow attackers to bypass authorization and access unauthorized functionality or data.

- **Cryptographic Failures**: Failing to properly implement cryptographic controls enables attackers to compromise sensitive data or functionality through insecure communications, weaker algorithms, or key management issues.

- **Injection**: Allowing untrusted input to be interpreted as commands or queries can lead to data loss, corruption, or takeover of processes.

- **Insecure Design**: Design flaws that undermine an application's security include excessive complexity, incorrect assumptions, lack of appropriate safeguards, and more.

- **Security Misconfiguration**: Insecure default configurations, incomplete configurations, open cloud storage, verbose errors, etc. empower attackers.

- **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**: Using components with known vulnerabilities leaves applications open to many different attacks.

- **Identification and Authentication Failures**: Flawed authentication, session management, or access control breaks the trust in user identities and their rights.

- **Software and Data Integrity Failures**: Code, data, and system integrity issues related to site reliability engineering failures or BEC attacks lead to harmful incidents.

- **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**: Not sufficiently detecting, alerting, responding to active attacks via logging and monitoring leads to breaches.

- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Attackers can abuse functionality to access or manipulate internal network resources that are not directly exposed.
The top 10 aims to raise awareness and provide guidance on addressing these critical risks. Implementing the recommended best practices can significantly improve application security.

To mitigate these risks, the OWASP Top 10 project provides detailed information, including how to test for each risk, code examples for various programming languages, and specific steps to prevent or remediate the issues. By understanding and implementing the recommended practices, organizations can improve their web application security and protect their users' data.
