# Introduction to FP-trees

FP-trees are an efficient data structure used in data mining to discover frequent itemsets and association rules in a dataset. They are used in conjunction with the Apriori algorithm to generate frequent itemsets and association rules in a given dataset. Building an FP-tree involves two main steps: scanning the dataset to identify frequent items and their frequency counts, and adding transactions to the tree structure. The tree is used to mine frequent itemsets and association rules by recursively traversing the tree and finding all paths that contain a given item.
