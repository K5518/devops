# ROC

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a performance metric used in binary classification problems to evaluate the quality of a model's predictions. ROC curves are graphical representations of the performance of a binary classifier system, plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) for different thresholds.
