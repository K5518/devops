# Hierarchical clustering 

Hierarchical clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm in machine learning that groups similar data points into clusters. The algorithm builds a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster has a parent cluster and several child clusters. The process of creating this hierarchy is called dendrogram.
