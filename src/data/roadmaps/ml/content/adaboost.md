# Ada booster

## What is adabooster

    AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (classifiers or regressors) to create a strong learner.

## Why we use ada booster?

"Adabooster" is not a commonly used term in machine learning or data science. It may be a misspelling of "Adaboost," which is an adaptive boosting algorithm used for binary classification problems.
