# Sci-Kit Learn

Whether you are just looking for an introduction to ML, want to get up and running fast, or are looking for the latest ML research tool, you will find that scikit-learn is both well-documented and easy to learn/use. As a high-level library, it lets you define a predictive data model in just a few lines of code, and then use that model to fit your data.  Itâ€™s versatile and integrates well with other Python libraries, such as matplotlib for plotting, numpy for array vectorization, and pandas for dataframes.
