# Polynomial Regression resources
**Polynomial regression** is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
In simple terms, it is a ***curve-fitting technique*** that fits a polynomial equation to the data points.
If your data points clearly will not fit a linear regression (a straight line through all data points), it might be ideal for polynomial regression.
There are several reasons why we might need polynomial regression. One reason is that many real-world phenomena have non-linear relationships.
