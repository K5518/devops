# Introduction to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping(SLAM)
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is a technique used in robotics and computer vision that allows a robot to create a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously localizing itself within that environment. There are many resources available for learning about SLAM, including textbooks, online courses, research papers, and software libraries.
