# OPTICS

Optics (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) is a machine learning algorithm used for clustering and identifying structure in datasets. It is a density-based clustering algorithm that finds clusters of varying shapes and sizes, and is useful for datasets with high variability in density.

For example:the algorithm may identify a cluster of customers who tend to buy products related to health and fitness, and another cluster of customers who tend to buy products related to fashion and beauty. By tailoring your marketing efforts to each cluster, you can increase customer engagement and sales.
