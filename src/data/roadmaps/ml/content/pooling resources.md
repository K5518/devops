# Pooling Resources

Pooling resources refers to the practice of combining or sharing resources, such as money, materials, equipment, or personnel, among multiple individuals or organizations to achieve a common goal or objective.

Pooling resources can be beneficial in various situations, such as during emergencies, disaster relief efforts, community development projects, research endeavors, or business ventures. By pooling resources, individuals or organizations can leverage their collective strengths, expertise, and resources to accomplish more than what they could do individually.
