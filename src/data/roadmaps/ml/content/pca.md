# Principal Component Analysis 

Principal component analysis(PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. Principal Component Analysis simplifies the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. Principal Component Analysis can help us improve performance at a meager cost of model accuracy.
