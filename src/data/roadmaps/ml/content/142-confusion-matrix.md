# CONFUSION MATRIX

A confusion matrix presents a table layout of the different outcomes of the prediction and results of a classification problem. It is used for evaluating the accuracy of a machine learning model in predicting outcomes by comparing its predicted values against actual values.And also identifies areas where it may need improvement. A confusion matrix has two dimensions - predicted values and actual values. It is a square matrix with four cells, each representing a possible outcome of the model's prediction. The rows of the matrix represent the predicted values, while the columns represent the actual values.
