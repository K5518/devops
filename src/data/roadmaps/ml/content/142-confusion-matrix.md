# ****CONFUSION MATRIX****

## **What is confusion matrix ?**

A confusion matrix presents a table layout of the different outcomes of the prediction and results of a classification problem. It is used for evaluating the accuracy of a machine learning model in predicting outcomes by comparing its predicted values against actual values.And also identifies areas where it may need improvement.

## **Layout**

A confusion matrix has two dimensions - predicted values and actual values. It is a square matrix with four cells, each representing a possible outcome of the model's prediction. The rows of the matrix represent the predicted values, while the columns represent the actual values. 

The four cells of the matrix are:

 True Positive (TP): The model predicted a positive outcome and it was correct.  

 True Negative (TN): The model predicted a negative outcome and it was correct.

 False Positive (FP): The model predicted a positive outcome but it was incorrect.

 False Negative (FN): The model predicted a negative outcome but it was incorrect.
