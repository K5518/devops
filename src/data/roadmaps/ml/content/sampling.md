# Sampling
 Sampling means selecting the group that you will actually collect data from in your research.Sampling is a technique of selecting individual members or a subset of the population to make statistical inferences from them and estimate the characteristics of the whole population. 
 
# Types of Sampling
 Sampling in market action research is of two types – probability sampling and non-probability sampling. Let’s take a closer look at thes two methods of sampling.

# Probability sampling 
Probability sampling is a sampling technique where a researcher selects a few criteria and chooses members of a population randomly. 

  ## Types of Probability Sampling
   Probability sampling is a technique in which researchers choose samples from a larger population based on the theory of probability.

  Simple random sampling
   
  Cluster sampling
   
  Systematic sampling
   
  Stratified random sampling
   
# Non-probability sampling:
 In non-probability sampling, the researcher randomly chooses members for research. This sampling method is not a fixed or predefined selection process. 
  ## Types of non-probability sampling
  The non-probability method is a sampling method that involves a collection of feedback based on a researcher or statistician’s sample selection capabilities and not on a fixed selection process.
   
  Convenience sampling

  Judgmental or purposive sampling
 
  Snowball sampling
  
  Quota sampling
