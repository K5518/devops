# Eigen vectors

In linear algebra, the eigenvectors of a square matrix are non-zero vectors which when multiplied by the square matrix would result in just the scalar multiple of the vectors. i.e., a vector v is said to be an eigenvector of a square matrix A if and only if A v = λ v, for some scalar λ.
