## Introduction To Eclat Algorithm
***
- ECLAT ___(Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal)___ is a popular algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets in transactional databases.

- The ECLAT algorithm works by building a vertical representation of the transaction database, where each item in the database is represented by a list of transactions in which it appears. 
## Advantages Of Eclat algorithm
***
There are several advantages of the ECLAT algorithm:

### Memory efficiency: 
ECLAT uses a vertical data format that reduces the memory usage as compared to the Apriori algorithm.
### Handles high sparsity:
-  ECLAT can handle datasets with a large number of items and high sparsity. T

### Scalability:
-  ECLAT can scale to handle larger datasets by exploiting parallel processing and other optimizations.
