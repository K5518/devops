# **Binomial Distribution:**

The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of successful outcomes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has the same probability of success. In machine learning, the binomial distribution is often used to model binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes.

### The probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution is given by:

    P(X = k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)

In machine learning, we can use the binomial distribution to estimate the probability of a certain outcome given a set of input features. We can then use this probability to make predictions and evaluate the performance of our model. For example, in logistic regression, we use the binomial distribution to model the probability of a binary outcome based on a linear combination of input features.
