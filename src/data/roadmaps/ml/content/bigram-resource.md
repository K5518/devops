# What is bigram

A bigram is a sequence of two adjacent items from a given sequence of tokens, where a token is typically a word, but can also be a character or any other unit of text. Bigrams are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics, particularly for tasks such as language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text classification
