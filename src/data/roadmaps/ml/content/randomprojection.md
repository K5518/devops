# Random projection

In mathematics and statistics, random projection is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a set of points which lie in Euclidean space. They have been applied to many natural language tasks under the name random indexing.
Random projections is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving important information. The idea behind random projections is to project high-dimensional data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace, while maintaining their pairwise distances as much as possible.
