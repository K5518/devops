Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees.


Random forest is a commonly-used machine learning algorithm which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result. 
for example, classifying whether an email is “spam” or “not spam”.
