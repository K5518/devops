# GradientBoost resources
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique that produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. Gradient Boosting iteratively trains the ensemble of models by fitting the next model to the residual errors of the previous models, and then combining the predictions of all models to produce a final prediction. Gradient Boosting is known for its ability to produce accurate predictions even with complex and high-dimensional data.
