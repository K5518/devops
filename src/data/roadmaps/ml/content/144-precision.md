# Precision
Precision is defined as follows: Precision = T P T P + F P.

# Binary Classification and Precision
In an imbalanced classification problem with two classes, precision is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives. The result is a value between 0.0 for no precision and 1.0 for full or perfect precision.

# Multi-class Classification and Precision
In an imbalanced classification problem with more than two classes, precision is calculated as the sum of true positives across all classes divided by the sum of true positives and false positives across all classes.

# Accuracy
Accuracy will tell us right away whether a model is being trained correctly and how it will work in general. It does not, however, provide specific details on how it applies to the issue.

# Conclusion
The number of positive class predictions that currently belong to the positive class is calculated by precision.
