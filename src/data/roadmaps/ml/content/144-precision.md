# Precision

Precision is defined as follows: Precision = T P T P + F P. In an imbalanced classification problem with two classes, precision is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives. The result is a value between 0.0 for no precision and 1.0 for full or perfect precision.
