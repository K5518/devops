# **FEATURE EXTRACTION**
## WHAT IS FEATURE EXTRACTION?
***
In real life, all the data we collect are in large amounts. To understand this data, we need a process. Manually, it is not possible to process them. Here’s when the concept of feature extraction comes in.It is the process of transforming raw data into numerical features that can be processed while preserving the information in the original data set.

### WHY IS FEATURE EXTRACTION USED  ?
***
 Feature Extraction aims to reduce the number of features in a dataset by creating new features from the existing ones (and then discarding the original features).

 ### FEATURE EXTRACTION MAKES MACHINE LEARNING MORE EFFICIENT
 ***
Feature extraction improves the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning. Here are four ways feature extraction enables machine learning models to better serve their intended purpose:  

Reduces redundant data:

Feature extraction cuts through the noise, removing redundant and unnecessary data. This frees machine learning programs to focus on the most relevant data. 

Improves model accuracy:

The most accurate machine learning models are those developed using only the data required to train the model to its intended business use. Including peripheral data negatively impacts the model’s accuracy.

Boosts speed of learning:

Including training data that doesn’t directly contribute to solving the business problem bogs down the learning process. Models trained on highly relevant data learn more quickly and make more accurate predictions. 

More-efficient use of compute resources:

Pruning out peripheral data boosts speed and efficiency. With less data to sift through, compute resources aren’t dedicated to processing tasks that aren’t generating additional value.

 #### APPLICATIONS OF FEATURE EXTRACTION:
 ***
 1. **Bag of Words**- Bag-of-Words is the most used technique for natural language processing. In this process they extract the words or the features from a sentence, document, website, etc. and then they classify them into the frequency of use. So in this whole process feature extraction is one of the most important parts.

1. **Image Processing** –Image processing is one of the best and most interesting domain. In this domain basically you will start playing with your images in order to understand them. So here we use many many techniques which includes feature extraction as well and algorithms to detect features such as shaped, edges, or motion in a digital image or video to process them.

2. **Auto-encoders**: The main  purpose of the auto-encoders is efficient data coding which is unsupervised in nature. this process comes under unsupervised learning . So Feature extraction procedure is applicable here to identify the key features from the data to code by learning from the coding of the original data set to derive new ones.

# EXAMPLES OF FEATURE EXTRACTION:

An example of a simple feature is the mean of a window in a signal. Automated feature extraction uses specialized algorithms or deep networks to extract features automatically from signals or images without the need for human intervention.

##### DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEATURE EXTRACTION 
***
We can now repeat a similar workflow as in the previous examples, this time using a simple Autoencoder as our Feature Extraction Technique.

1. Denoising Autoencoder
2. Variational Autoencoder.
3. Convolutional Autoencoder.
4. Sparse Autoencoder.
