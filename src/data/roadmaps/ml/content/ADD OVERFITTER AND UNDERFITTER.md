# Underfitting:
 A statistical model or a machine learning algorithm is said to have underfitting when it cannot capture the underlying trend of the data, i.e., it only performs well on training data but performs poorly on testing data. (Itâ€™s just like trying to fit undersized pants!) Underfitting destroys the accuracy of our machine learning model. Its occurrence simply means that our model or the algorithm does not fit the data well enough. It usually happens when we have fewer data to build an accurate model and also when we try to build a linear model with fewer non-linear data. In such cases, the rules of the machine learning model are too easy and flexible to be applied to such minimal data and therefore the model will probably make a lot of wrong predictions. Underfitting can be avoided by using more data and also reducing the features by feature selection.

# Overfitting: #

A statistical model is said to be overfitted when the model does not make accurate predictions on testing data. When a model gets trained with so much data, it starts learning from the noise and inaccurate data entries in our data set. And when testing with test data results in High variance. Then the model does not categorize the data correctly, because of too many details and noise. The causes of overfitting are the non-parametric and non-linear methods because these types of machine learning algorithms have more freedom in building the model based on the dataset and therefore they can really build unrealistic models. A solution to avoid overfitting is using a linear algorithm if we have linear data or using the parameters like the maximal depth if we are using decision trees.
