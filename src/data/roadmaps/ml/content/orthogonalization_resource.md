# Orthogonalization Resource
## Orthogonalization process:

An algorithm to construct for a given linear independent system of vectors in a Euclidean or Hermitian space V
 an orthogonal system of non-zero vectors generating the same subspace in V
. The most well-known is the Schmidt (or Gram–Schmidt) orthogonalization process, in which from a linear independent system a1,…,ak
, an orthogonal system b1,…,bk
 is constructed such that every vector bi
 (i=1,…,k
) is linearly expressed in terms of a1,…,ai
, i.e. bi=∑ij=1γijaj
, where C=∥γij∥
 is an upper-triangular matrix. It is possible to construct the system {bi}
 such that it is orthonormal and such that the diagonal entries γii
 of C
 are positive; the system {bi}
 and the matrix C
 are defined uniquely by these conditions.
