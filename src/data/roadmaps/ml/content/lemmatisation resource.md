# Lemmatisation resources

## what is lemmatisation?
Lemmatization is the process of grouping together different inflected forms of the same word. It's used in computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP) and chatbots. Lemmatization links similar meaning words as one word, making tools such as chatbots and search engine queries more effective and accurate.
