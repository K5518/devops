# T-SNE

T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. T-SNE a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm finds patterns in the data based on the similarity of data points with features, the similarity of points is calculated as the conditional probability that a point A would choose point B as its neighbour. It then tries to minimize the difference between these conditional probabilities (or similarities) in higher-dimensional and lower-dimensional space for a perfect representation of data points in lower-dimensional space.
