# What Is Denoising?
  1. In computer graphics, images can be made up of both useful information and noise. 
  2. The latter reduces clarity. The ideal end product of denoising would be a crisp image that only preserves the useful information.
  3.  When denoising an image, itâ€™s also important to keep visual details and components such as edges, corners, textures and other sharp structures.
