# What is Generative Adversarial Network?

## A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks that create new data instances that resemble your training data, even though the faces donâ€™t belong to any real person. They achieve this level of realism by pairing a generator, which learns to produce the target output, with a discriminator, which learns to distinguish true data from the output of the generator.
