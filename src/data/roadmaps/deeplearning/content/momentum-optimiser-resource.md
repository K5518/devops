# Momentum Optimiser 

Momentum is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning that helps accelerate the gradient descent process by keeping track of the previous gradients and adding a fraction of the previous gradients to the current gradient.In the context of deep learning, momentum can be thought of as adding a velocity term to the optimization process, which helps to smooth out the optimization path and avoid getting stuck in local minima.Overall, momentum optimization is a powerful and widely-used optimization algorithm in deep learning that can help speed up the training process and improve model performance.
