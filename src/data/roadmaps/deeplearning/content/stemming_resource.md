# Stemming :

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as "lemmas". Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP)

Stemming is a natural language processing technique that lowers inflection in words to their root forms, hence aiding in the preprocessing of text, words, and documents for text normalization.

In general, the advantages of stemming are that it's straightforward to implement and fast to run.
