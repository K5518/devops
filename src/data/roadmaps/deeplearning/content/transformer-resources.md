# Transformer

Transformer resources are a type of deep learning algorithm used in natural language processing (NLP). They are based on the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network architecture.transformer resources uses self-attention layers  to learn patterns in sequences of data. This technology enables the machine to learn relationships between words and phrases in a piece of text, allowing it to better understand the text and generate more accurate predictions.
