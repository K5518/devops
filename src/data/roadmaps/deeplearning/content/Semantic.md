 # Semantic Annotation
 
 Semantic annotation is a process of adding meaning to text data. This can be done by assigning a semantic meaning to each word or phrase in a document, or by tagging individual documents with semantic information.Semantic annotation is a valuable resource for understanding the meaning of words and phrases in a text. This information can be used to improve the clarity of the text, and to help users find specific information.
