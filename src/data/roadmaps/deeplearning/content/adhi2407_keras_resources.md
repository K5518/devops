# About Keras
1. Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. 
2. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.
# Keras features
1.  Simple - but not simplistic. Keras reduces developer cognitive load to free you to focus on the parts of the problem that really matter.
2. Powerful -- Keras provides industry-strength performance and scalability: it is used by organizations and companies including NASA, YouTube, or Waymo.
