# ACTIVATION FUNCTION
## DEFINITION:
An activation function is a function used in artificial neural networks which outputs a small value for small inputs, and a larger value if its inputs exceed a threshold. If the inputs are large enough, the activation function "fires", otherwise it does nothing. In other words, an activation function is like a gate that checks that an incoming value is greater than a critical number.
