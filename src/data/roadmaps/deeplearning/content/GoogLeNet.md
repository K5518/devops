# GoogLeNet?

GoogLeNet is a convolutional neural network that is 22 layers deep.It is a variant of the Inception Network, developed by researchers at Google. It utilises Inception modules to choose between multiple convolutional filter sizes in each block, with occasional max-pooling layers with stride 2 to halve the number of filter sizes.
