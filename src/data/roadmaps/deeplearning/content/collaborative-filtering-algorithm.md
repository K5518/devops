# Collaborative Filtering Algorithm

Collaborative filtering is a machine learning algorithm used for recommendation systems. It predicts the preferences of a user based on the preferences of other users who have similar tastes.
Collaborative filtering uses a matrix of user-item ratings to find similarities between users and items. The algorithm identifies users who have similar ratings on the same items and recommends items that one user has rated highly to another user with similar tastes. This is known as user-based collaborative filtering.
