# Specificity

Specificity itself can be described as the algorithm/modelâ€™s ability to predict a true negative of each category available. In literature, it is also known simply as the true negative rate. Formally it can be calculated by the equation below
Specificity = TN / TN + FP (True Negative/True Negative + False Positive)
