# Convolution Neural Network 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. They are designed to process and analyze images in a hierarchical manner, using multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations to extract and learn features from the input data. CNNs are inspired by the structure and function of the visual cortex in the human brain, and have achieved state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks. There are many resources available for learning about CNNs, including online courses, books, tutorials, and research papers.
