<blockquote>
<p>Do not store application state on servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for this is so that if you server gets killed, you won’t lose any application state. To that end, sessions should be stored in a database (or some other sort of central storage; memcached, redis, etc.), not on the local filesystem. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logs should be handled via syslog (or similar) and sent to a remote store.</li>
<li>Uploads should go direct to S3 (don’t store on local filesystem and have another process move to S3 for example). For S3 you can use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pre-signed URLs</a> to let your users directly upload to S3 by bypassing your server entirely.</li>
<li>Any post-processing or long running tasks should be done via an asynchronous queue (SQS is great for this).</li>
</ul>
