<p>Use the free metrics.</p>

<p>CloudWatch monitors all sorts of things for free (bandwidth, CPU usage, etc.), and you get up to 2 weeks of historical data. This saves you having to use your own tools to monitor you systems. If you need longer than 2 weeks, unfortunately you’ll need to use a third-party or custom built monitoring solution.</p>
