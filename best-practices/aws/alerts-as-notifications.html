<blockquote>
<p>Get your alerts to become notifications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve set everything up correctly, your health checks should automatically destroy bad instances and spawn new ones. There’s usually no action to take when getting a CloudWatch alert, as everything should be automated. If you’re getting alerts where manual intervention is required, do a post-mortem and figure out if there’s a way you can automate the action in future. The last time I had an actionable alert from CloudWatch was about a year ago, and it’s extremely awesome not to be woken up at 4am for ops alerts any more.</p>
