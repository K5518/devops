<p>Assign permissions to groups, not users.</p>

<p>Managing users can be a pain, if you’re using Active Directory, or some other external authentication mechanism which you’ve integrated with IAM, then this probably won’t matter as much (or maybe it matters more). But I’ve found it much easier to manage permissions by assigning them only to groups, rather than to individual users. It’s much easier to rein in permissions and get an overall view of the system than going through each individual user to see what permissions have been assigned.</p>
