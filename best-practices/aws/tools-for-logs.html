<blockquote>
<p>Have tools to view application logs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should have an admin tool, syslog viewer, or something that allows you to view current real-time log info without needing to SSH into a running instance. If you have centralised logging (which you really should), then you just want to be sure you can read the logs there without needing to use SSH. Needing to SSH into a running application instance to view logs is going to become problematic.</p>
