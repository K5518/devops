<blockquote>
<p>Use custom metrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to monitor things not covered by the free metrics, you can send your own metric information to CloudWatch and make use of the alarms and graphing features. This can not only be used for things like tracking diskspace usage, but also for custom application metrics too. The AWS page on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">publishing custom metrics</a> has more information.</p>
