<p>Backend performance in web applications greatly depends on the selection of architectural styles like Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Microservices and the ability to decompose services when necessary. For instance, using Microservices, an application is broken into smaller, loosely coupled services, making it easy to maintain and scale, improving the overall backend performance. Service decomposition, on the other hand, allows for the distribution of responsibilities, meaning if one service fails, it won’t likely impact the entire system. Thus, understanding and efficiently managing architectural styles and service decomposition are critical for the optimized backend performance in web applications.</p>
