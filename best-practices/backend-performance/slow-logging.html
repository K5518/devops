<p>Keeping tabs on slow-query logging is vital for backend performance since it can help in identifying inefficient queries that may drag down the server’s productivity. For instance, a slow query might be taking an exceptionally long time to navigate through a large database, causing delays in information retrieval. By enabling slow-query logging, such ineffective queries can be spotted and optimized or reworked to minimize their run-time. Thus, it aids in maintaining smooth and efficient server operation while enhancing the application’s overall performance. Continuous monitoring of these logs can also point out recurring issues that need addressing, making it an indispensable tool for optimizing backend performance.</p>
