<p>The optimisation of backend performance in web applications involves proactively fetching or loading resources, data, or dependencies needed for future requests. By performing these operations in advance, costly delays (latency) are reduced significantly. This process ensures that resources are available as soon as they are required, resulting in a seamless and faster interaction for users. For instance, when a user opens a site, if images or other data that are likely to be used next are already preloaded, the user will not experience any delay as these elements load. As such, prefetching or preloading is critical to improve the overall speed of a web application, directly enhancing user experience.</p>
