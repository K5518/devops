<p>Backend performance of web applications can see substantial improvements when effective caching mechanisms, like HTTP, server/client, and CDN are properly implemented. Caching can significantly decrease the load on the server, minimising the effort necessary to generate a response to a user’s request. For example, when a user revisits a previously accessed web page, caching mechanisms retrieve stored information more swiftly than the server could generate it. This process effectively cuts down on latency, bandwidth usage and processing power, speeding up the loading times and contributing to smoother user experience. CDN-based caches also help in serving static resources to users from the nearest possible location, reducing network latency.</p>
