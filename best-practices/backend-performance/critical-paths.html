<p>In web applications, maintaining the overall system health is crucial, and an important aspect of this is the optimization of critical paths and frequently accessed endpoints. These paths and endpoints act as the vital junctions where most user requests are processed, converted, and delivered as output. Proper identification and optimization of these routes ensure seamless user experience and high-speed data delivery. For instance, when a user logs on to an e-commerce website, the critical paths may include user authentication, product search, and payment gateway. Prioritizing the performance of these backend endpoints helps in reducing latency and enhances page load speed, preserving optimum overall system health.</p>
