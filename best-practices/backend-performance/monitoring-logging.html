<p>Backend performance can significantly affect the functionality and user experience of a web application. This necessitates the implementation of comprehensive monitoring and logging to track performance metrics and troubleshoot issues. These tactics give us eyes and ears within the performance of our application’s infrastructure, helping identify potential bottlenecks or breakdowns. For example, monitoring could reveal that a particular database operation is taking longer than expected, which could be the cue to optimize the associated query. Similarly, logging will give us detailed records of application events, allowing us to trace and resolve any errors or issues captured in these logs. Unresolved issues can often slow down backend operations, or hamper their working altogether, hence impacting performance. Therefore, effective application of monitoring and validating logging data can enhance backend efficiency and bring valuable insights for further improvement.</p>
