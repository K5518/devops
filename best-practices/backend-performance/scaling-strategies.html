<p>An optimal backend performance in web applications relies heavily on implementing the right type of scaling, whether horizontal or vertical. In vertical scaling, additional resources are added to increase the capacity of an existing machine. It helps in the short run by quickly accommodating an increased load, but may be limited by the maximum capacity of individual servers. In contrast, horizontal scaling provides longer-term scalability by adding more machines to the existing pool. This improves the redundancy and reliability of the application and can handle significantly larger loads without relying on high-spec servers. A careful balance or judicious use of both can drastically improve backend performance. For example, a sudden surge in website traffic can be swiftly managed with vertical scaling while consistent long-term growth can be accommodated with horizontal scaling. Therefore, the decision of using horizontal or vertical scaling is pivotal in determining backend performance.</p>
