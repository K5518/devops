<p>Backend performance in web applications can significantly be improved with efficient pagination for large datasets. When data-loaded in an application is quite extensive, executing simple queries without pagination can slow down response times, producing an adverse user experience. Through pagination, applications can deliver data in smaller, manageable chunks, reducing the amount of data transferred on each request and thereby increasing the speed and performance of the backend. For instance, instead of retrieving a million records at once, the application retrieves chunks of 50 or 100 at a time, dramatically enhancing the performance.</p>
