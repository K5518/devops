<p>Optimizing the backend performance of web applications often necessitates the enablement of compression for responses. Compression methods, such as Gzip or Brotli, reduce the size of the data transmitted between the server and the client. This result in faster data transfer, minimizing the load time of the web page and improving the user experience. For instance, if a web page has a size of 100 KB, applying compression can reduce it to 30 KB. This means less data to download, hence quicker loading times. Therefore, enabling compression for responses is critical in making web applications more efficient and responsive.</p>
