<p>Backend performance enhancement heavily relies on effective communication between diverse services. Message brokers, in this context, prove to be an essential instrument as they facilitate asynchronous communication, a method which boosts the system’s overall performance by allowing multiple operations to occur simultaneously. For instance, in a web application that processes online payments, a message broker can permit the receipt of payments (one service) to occur concurrently with updating the user’s payment history (another service). This prevents delays and halts, which means end users receive faster and smoother experiences. An improved backend performance, characterized by efficiency and time-effectiveness, makes this possible.</p>
