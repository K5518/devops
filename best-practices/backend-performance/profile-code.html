<p>The effective performance of a web application’s backend heavily relies on the smooth operation of its code. Profiling is the process of monitoring the behaviour of your code, including the frequency and duration of function calls. This allows for the identification of performance bottlenecks—specific parts of the code that impede optimal performance. For example, a function that requires significant processing power and slows down the application can be revealed through code profiling. By identifying and resolving these bottlenecks, the backend performance can be dramatically improved, leading to faster response times and enhanced user experience.</p>
