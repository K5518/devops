<blockquote>
<p>Audit your design and implementation with unit/integration tests coverage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unit and integration testing can help identify vulnerabilities in the API code and design, such as input validation errors, authentication and authorization flaws, and other security-related issues. By performing comprehensive testing, developers can ensure that the API works as intended and that it is secure against common attacks such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and other exploits. Adequate testing can also help identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, improve scalability and reliability, and ensure the overall quality of the API.</p>
