<blockquote>
<p>You should avoid using basic authentication and use any other standard authentication methodologies i.e. OAuth, JWT, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basic authentication is a simple method for authenticating a user by transmitting the user’s credentials in plain text over the network. This method is inherently insecure and should be avoided whenever possible.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why basic authentication should be avoided and replaced with more secure authentication techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of confidentiality: Basic authentication transmits the user’s credentials (username and password) in plain text over the network. This means that anyone who intercepts the traffic can easily read the credentials and gain access to the user’s account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of integrity: Basic authentication does not provide any mechanism to ensure that the data being transmitted has not been tampered with or modified in transit. This means that an attacker can modify the traffic to gain access to the user’s account or perform other malicious activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of authentication strength: Basic authentication relies solely on the user’s credentials to authenticate them. This means that if an attacker is able to obtain the user’s credentials (for example, through phishing or social engineering), they can easily gain access to the user’s account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No support for multi-factor authentication: Basic authentication does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is a critical security feature that provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, other authentication techniques such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML provide more secure and robust methods for authentication. These methods typically use encrypted protocols to protect the user’s credentials, provide mechanisms for verifying the integrity of the data, and support MFA. As a result, they are much more secure and reliable than basic authentication and should be used whenever possible.</p>
