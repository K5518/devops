<blockquote>
<p>Token expiry should be set to a reasonable time to reduce the window of vulnerability, limit the impact of token theft, and improve overall security.</p>

<p>Setting a short token expiration time (TTL, RTTL) is important for security purposes, as it reduces the window of vulnerability, limits the impact of token theft, and improves overall security. However, the expiration time should be balanced with usability, as setting it too short may inconvenience users and reduce productivity.</p>
