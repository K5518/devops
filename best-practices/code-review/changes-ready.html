<p>I cannot emphasize enough the significance of submitting a well-prepared code change for review. This not only saves time for the reviewer and the author but also helps maintain high-quality code in the repository. Here are some essential tips to make sure that your code changes are complete and review-ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Verify that you have thoroughly tested your changes in different scenarios to confirm that they work as expected and do not introduce any new issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you have written appropriate unit tests for your changes. These tests should be concise, well-structured, and cover all the possible scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your code follows the project’s coding standards and style guides. Consistency in style makes the code easier to read and maintain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include clear and concise commit messages that provide context and background information about the changes made. This will help the reviewer understand the purpose and reasoning behind the changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update or add documentation related to your changes, if necessary. This can include in-code comments, user-facing documentation, or developer-focused guides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before submitting your changes, perform a self-review. Reexamine your code closely to catch any potential issues or suggest improvements yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following these tips, you will increase the likelihood of your code changes being accepted promptly and contribute to a smoother, more efficient code review process.</p>
