<p>I highly recommend leaving comments to suggest improvements, as this helps ensure high quality and maintainable code. However, it is important to differentiate between critical revisions and those elements that have room for improvement but can be considered as “nice to have.” To indicate these less critical suggestions, we use the prefix “Nit.” They convey that your suggestion is a minor point and helps the developer understand the reviewer’s perspective on the importance of the suggestion. This allows them to prioritize their revisions effectively. Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When leaving a comment or suggestion, consider whether it is critical to meeting the coding standards or offering a significant improvement to the code. If not, prefix your comment with “Nit.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage a balanced approach to comments, where you highlight both critical and non-critical suggestions. This allows the developer to address important aspects, while being aware of opportunities for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When reviewing code, always ensure you give positive feedback as well. This points out what the developer is doing right, and offers motivation to continue doing great work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your comments, be specific and clear about what needs improvement, keeping in mind that the developer may not have the same context as you. This will facilitate productive discussions and faster decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By following this practice, you create a healthy environment for code review that fosters open communication, learning, and improvement while making sure that critical standards are met.</p>
