<p>Encouraging reviewing code in unknown-areas for cross-functional knowledge not only helps the reviewer gain insights into different sections of the project but also enables the team to have a broader understanding of the system as a whole. This practice can be highly beneficial in improving code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among team members.</p>
<p>To ensure this practice is followed, we provide you with the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a culture where team members are encouraged to learn and are not hesitant to review code beyond their immediate circle of expertise.</li>
<li>Define a clear process for code review assignments, considering reviews from diverse areas of the project.</li>
<li>Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions or training workshops to increase familiarity with different sections of the codebase.</li>
<li>Use tools and automation to recommend code reviews based on individual skill levels and previous review experiences, promoting diversity in assigned projects.</li>
<li>Provide constructive feedback during reviews and maintain open communication channels to facilitate knowledge sharing and discussion.</li>
</ul>
