<p>Writing automated tests is an essential best practice that plays a monumental role in assuring the software’s overall quality and stability. Automated tests not only exercise specific elements of your code, but they also ensure that your code functions correctly by systematically pinpointing issues that may not surface during casual usage. Incorporating automated testing into your code review process is indispensable, as it allows you to confidently approve code changes knowing that they perform as expected.</p>
<p>To make sure you’re following this practice, here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prioritize test coverage: Remember to write tests that cover the most important functionality of your code. Consider focusing on edge cases, error handling, and integrations with other components of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a test framework: Leverage a testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and executing tests. This will help you create well-structured, organized, and maintainable test suites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopt a test-driven development approach: Writing tests before implementing the code ensures that you have a well-defined outline of what the code should do. This methodology helps you design the code accurately and efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make testing part of your development process: To ensure that tests are written and maintained, introduce a consensus within your team that code changes should always be accompanied by appropriate tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep tests up to date: As code evolves, ensure that the test suite continues to accurately reflect the software’s functionality. Update and refactor tests if requirements change, and delete any deprecated tests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, leveraging automated tests during code review not only helps validate the code but also maintains the software’s overall integrity and reliability, ultimately making it better for end-users.</p>
