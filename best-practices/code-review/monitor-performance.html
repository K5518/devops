<p>Monitoring the performance and functionality of code changes is a crucial aspect of the code review process that ensures the seamless integration of new modifications without compromising on the overall system’s efficiency. As an integral part of quality assurance, this practice helps to identify and address potential issues early on, minimizing the risk of disruptive performance problems down the line.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to help you monitor the performance of code changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct thorough testing: Perform rigorous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, to ensure the functionality and examine how the new code impacts the system’s performance, covering different scenarios and use cases.</li>
<li>Use profiling tools: Utilize monitoring and profiling tools to gauge the performance of the code changes and identify any slowdowns, bottlenecks, or resource usage problems.</li>
<li>Monitor logs and analytics: Keep an eye on logs and analytics for any unusual activity or errors, which could indicate issues introduced by the new code changes.</li>
<li>Set performance benchmarks/targets: Establish predetermined benchmarks for performance measures, such as response time or resource usage, to simplify the process of identifying code changes that have negatively impacted the system.</li>
<li>Follow up during and after deployment: Periodically review the code changes and their impact, especially during and after the deployment phase. This will help to optimize performance, as well as maintain the quality and stability of the overall system.</li>
<li>Foster open communication: Encourage open communication among team members to quickly address concerns, share insights, and collaborate on solutions to performance-related issues.</li>
