<p>As a vital aspect of the code review process, it is essential to ensure that any changes made to the codebase are accurately reflected in the associated documentation and code comments. Consistently updating these elements helps maintain clear understanding, facilitates collaboration, and boosts a project’s long-term maintainability. Below are some tips on making sure you thoroughly update documentation and code comments during a review:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cross-reference changes: Whenever a code change is made, always verify if there are any related comments, documentation sections, or code examples that need updating as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anticipate future maintenance: Consider how the changes made in the code may affect future developers or users. Update any relevant notes, warnings, or explanations in the documentation to address potential confusion or issues that may arise in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examine external dependencies: Sometimes, changes may impact external tools or libraries used in the project. Be sure to update any corresponding information in the documentation to reflect the new configurations, requirements, or instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review variable and function names: If your code changes involve renaming variables or functions, make sure to update all associated comments and documentation to maintain clarity and consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proofread and test: After updating the documentation and code comments, proofread for clarity, correctness, and proper formatting. Additionally, test any code examples or usage instructions provided to ensure they remain accurate and functional.</p>
</li>
