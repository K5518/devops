<p>Veryfing the change is a crucial step in the code review process that ensures the recently merged changes work correctly and do not cause any unexpected disruptions when deployed to the live production environment. Rigorous testing before deployment helps minimize the risks, but having an additional layer of validation post-deployment provides you with the confidence that your code changes are working as intended while interacting with real users and production data. To make sure of this, consider the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement automated monitoring and alerting systems to keep track of your application’s key performance indicators (KPIs) and notify you in case of a significant change in the metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate feature flags or toggles, allowing you to easily enable or disable specific changes in your code, making the process of identifying and resolving issues in production faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform smoke tests, which are quick and basic functional checks that help confirm the operational stability of your application after deploying new changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe user interaction through user analytics, bug reports, or direct feedback to assess whether the code change has had the intended impact and is positively affecting the user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish strategies for gradual deployment, such as canary or blue-green deployments, to minimize the potential impact of a problematic change on your entire user base and ensure smoother rollback if needed.</p>
