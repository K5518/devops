<p>In software development, it’s crucial to consider the impact that any proposed changes to the code might have on other parts of the system. Modifications in one area might inadvertently affect the behavior of seemingly unrelated components, leading to unexpected issues and bugs. As the code reviewer, it is your responsibility to be mindful of potential side effects and to ensure that the proposed changes promote stability and maintainability. In this section, we will discuss strategies you can employ to evaluate the impact of changes on the overall system and offer tips to help you confirm that any modifications will not introduce new problems or conflicts. Remember, the goal is to improve the codebase and maintain the integrity of the system as a whole.</p>
