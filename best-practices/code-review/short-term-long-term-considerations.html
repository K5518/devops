<p>In a well-balanced code review, it is essential to keep both short-term and long-term considerations in mind. Short-term considerations focus on the immediate impact of the changes, such as bug fixes, performance improvements, and adherence to coding standards. On the other hand, long-term considerations are aimed at ensuring the code remains maintainable, scalable, and aligned with the broader architectural vision. As a code reviewer, it is your responsibility to strike a balance between these two aspects, making sure your feedback addresses immediate concerns without compromising the codebase’s future health. Here are some tips to help you achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage the use of design patterns and architectural best practices that promote maintainability and adaptability.</li>
<li>Check for code readability and simplicity, as these contribute to easier future modifications.</li>
<li>Consider the impact of changes on existing and potential integrations, keeping in mind the system’s overall extensibility.</li>
<li>Ensure new features or improvements are justified, avoiding the addition of unnecessary complexity that may hinder future development.</li>
<li>Encourage documentation for any non-trivial code or design decisions, which helps other developers understand the rationale behind the change and avoids potential issues down the line.</li>
<li>Consider if the proposed solution aligns with the team’s overall coding practices, tech stack, and organizational goals, ensuring a coherent and unified codebase.</li>
</ul>
