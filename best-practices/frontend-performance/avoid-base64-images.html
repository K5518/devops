<blockquote>
<p>You could eventually convert tiny images to base64 but it’s actually not the best practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using Base64 encoded images in your frontend can have several drawbacks.</p>
<p>First, Base64 encoded images are larger in size than their binary counterparts, which can slow down the loading time of your website.</p>
<p>Second, because Base64 encoded images are embedded directly in the HTML or CSS, they are included in the initial page load, which can cause delays for users with slower internet connections.</p>
<p>Third, Base64 encoded images do not benefit from browser caching, as they are part of the HTML or CSS and not a separate resource. So, every time the page is loaded, the images will be re-downloaded, even if the user has visited the page before.</p>
<p>Fourth, Base64 encoded images are not compatible with some old browser versions.</p>
<p>Instead of using Base64 encoded images, it is generally recommended to use binary image files and reference them using an img tag in HTML, with a standard src attribute. This allows the browser to cache the image and use it for subsequent page loads, resulting in faster loading times and better user experience.</p>
