<p>Sketch is a powerful digital design tool specifically tailored for user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design. As part of the creative process, designers use Sketch to create wireframes, visual mockups, and interactive prototypes that help plan and iterate their ideas.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Vector-based:</strong> Unlike pixel-based software (such as Photoshop), Sketch uses vector shapes, enabling you to create crisp and clean designs that can scale to any resolution without losing quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Artboards:</strong> Artboards provide designated spaces within your canvas to create designs for various screen sizes, devices and orientations. This makes it easier to design and test responsive layouts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbols:</strong> Symbols are reusable design components, such as buttons, icons, or navigation menus. When you update a symbol, all instances of it across your designs will be updated, making it a huge time-saver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Export options:</strong> Sketch supports multiple export formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.) and provides options to optimize your assets for different platforms, such as iOS or Android.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Plugins:</strong> Sketch offers a wide range of plugins and integrations for collaborative work and extends its functionality via community-driven addons.</p>
