<p>IAM, or Identity and Access Management, in AWS is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. It allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. The service includes features like shared access to your AWS account, granular permissions, identity federation (including active directory integration), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and providing temporary access for users, among others. IAM is a universal system, meaning it’s globally accessible and does not depend on specific regions.</p>
