<p>Serialization in server-side game development is the process of transforming data objects or structures into a format that can be stored, transmitted, and reconstructed later. It’s significant because it enables you to save the state of a game, pass it between servers, or send it to clients. The two main types of serialization are binary and XML/JSON. Binary serialization turns your objects into a very compact binary format. XML/JSON serialization turns your objects into a textual format, which is less efficient but more human-readable and easier to debug. Depending on your specific needs, you may choose one over the other. Note also that each of these methods has its own exacerbations in terms of compatibility, performance, and security implications.</p>
