<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a dedicated software virtual stack that executes smart contract bytecode and is integrated into each Ethereum node. Simply said, EVM is a software framework that allows developers to construct Ethereum-based decentralized applications (DApps). All Ethereum accounts and smart contracts are stored on this virtual computer.</p>
<p>Many blockchains have forked the Ethereum blockchain and added functionality on top, these blockchains are referred to as EVM-based blockchains.</p>
