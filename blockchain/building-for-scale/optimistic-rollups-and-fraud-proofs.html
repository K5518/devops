<p>‍Optimistic rollups are a layer 2 (L2) construction that improves throughput and latency on Ethereum’s base layer by moving computation and data storage off-chain. An optimistic rollup processes transactions outside of Ethereum Mainnet, reducing congestion on the base layer and improving scalability.</p>
<p>Optimistic rollups allow anyone to publish blocks without providing proofs of validity. However, to ensure the chain remains safe, optimistic rollups specify a time window during which anyone can dispute a state transition.</p>
