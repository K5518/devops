<p>Canary Deployments is a technique used in Kubernetes to gradually roll out new versions of an application by directing a small percentage of users or traffic to the new version while the majority continue using the old version. This approach allows for testing the new version under real-world conditions before fully committing to the update. In Kubernetes, canary deployments can be implemented using tools such as Istio, Linkerd, or Nginx, or by using built-in features like deployment strategies and traffic routing.</p>
