<p>In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of a variable or how it can be used after it is declared. The scope of a variable depends on the keyword that was used to declare it.</p>
<p>The three types of Scope are Global Scope, Function Scope, and Block Scope. Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope with the <code>var</code> keyword. ES6 introduced <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> which allow Block Scope in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or curly braces ’{}’ have Global Scope, and can be accessed from anywhere within the same Javascript code. <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> all provide this Scope.</p>
<p>Function Scope: Variables declared within a function can only be used within that same function. Outside that function, they are undefined. <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> all provide this Scope.</p>
<p>Block Scope: A block is any part of JavaScript code bounded by ’{}‘. Variables declared within a block can not be accessed outside that block. This Scope is only provided by the <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> keywords. If you declare a variable within a block using the <code>var</code> keyword, it will NOT have Block Scope.</p>
<p>Local Scope: Local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed. <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> all provide this Scope.</p>
