<p>Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocate the memory you need</li>
<li>Use the allocated memory (read, write)</li>
<li>Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part is explicit in all languages. The first and last parts are explicit in low-level languages but are mostly implicit in high-level languages like JavaScript.</p>
