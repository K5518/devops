<p>The PACELC Theorem is an extension of the CAP Theorem. One of the questions that CAP Theorem wasn’t able to answer was “what happens when there is no Partition, What Logical Combination then a Distributed System have?“. So to answer this, In addition to Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance it also includes Latency as one of the desired properties of a Distributed System. The acronym PACELC stands for Partitioned, Availability, Consistency Else Latency, Consistency.</p>
