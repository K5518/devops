<h1 id="unicode">Unicode</h1>
<p>Unicode is a standard for encoding characters. It is a superset of ASCII, which means that ASCII is a subset of Unicode. Unicode is a 16-bit encoding, which means that it can encode 2^16 = 65536 characters. This is a lot more than ASCII, which can only encode 128 characters.</p>
