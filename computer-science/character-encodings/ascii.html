<p>ASCII is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. It was developed from telegraph code and uses 7 bits to represent 128 different characters. The first 32 characters are non-printable control characters used to control devices like printers and typewriters. The remaining 96 characters are printable and include the letters of the English alphabet, numbers, punctuation, and various symbols.</p>
