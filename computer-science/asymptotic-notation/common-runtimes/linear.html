<h1 id="linear">Linear</h1>
<p>Linear algorithms are algorithms that have a runtime that is directly proportional to the size of the input. This means that the runtime of the algorithm will increase linearly with the size of the input. For example, if the input size is 10, the runtime will be 10 times the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is 1. If the input size is 100, the runtime will be 100 times the runtime of the algorithm when the input size is 1.</p>
