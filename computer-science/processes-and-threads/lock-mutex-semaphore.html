<h1 id="lock--mutex--semaphore">Lock / Mutex / Semaphore</h1>
<p>A lock allows only one thread to enter the part that’s locked and the lock is not shared with any other processes.</p>
<p>A mutex is the same as a lock but it can be system wide (shared by multiple processes).</p>
<p>A semaphore does the same as a mutex but allows x number of threads to enter, this can be used for example to limit the number of cpu, io or ram intensive tasks running at the same time.</p>
