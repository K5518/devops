<h1 id="graph-representation">Graph Representation</h1>
<p>A graph can either be represented as an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.</p>
<p>The adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size <code>V x V</code> where <code>V</code> is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be <code>adj[][]</code>, a slot <code>adj[i][j] = 1</code> indicates that there is an edge from vertex <code>i</code> to vertex <code>j</code>.</p>
<p>Adjacency list is an array of vectors. Size of the array is equal to the number of vertices. Let the array be <code>array[]</code>. An entry <code>array[i]</code> represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.</p>
