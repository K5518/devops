<p>Bellman ford’s algorithm is a graph algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph. It is a dynamic programming algorithm that uses a bottom-up approach to find the shortest path. It is similar to Dijkstra’s algorithm but it can handle negative weights. It is also similar to Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm but it can handle negative weights and it is faster than Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm.</p>
