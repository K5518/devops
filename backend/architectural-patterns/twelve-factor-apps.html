<p>The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building scalable and maintainable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. It is based on a set of best practices that were identified by the authors of the methodology as being essential for building modern, cloud-native applications.</p>
<p>The Twelve-Factor App methodology consists of the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codebase: There should be a single codebase for the application, with multiple deployments.</li>
<li>Dependencies: The application should explicitly declare and isolate its dependencies.</li>
<li>Config: The application should store configuration in the environment.</li>
<li>Backing services: The application should treat backing services as attached resources.</li>
<li>Build, release, run: The application should be built, released, and run as an isolated unit.</li>
<li>Processes: The application should be executed as one or more stateless processes.</li>
<li>Port binding: The application should expose its services through port binding.</li>
<li>Concurrency: The application should scale out by adding more processes, not by adding threads.</li>
<li>Disposability: The application should be designed to start and stop quickly.</li>
<li>Dev/prod parity: The development, staging, and production environments should be as similar as possible.</li>
<li>Logs: The application should treat logs as event streams.</li>
<li>Admin processes: The application should run admin/maintenance tasks as one-off processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Twelve-Factor App methodology is widely adopted by developers of SaaS applications, and it is seen as a best practice for building cloud-native applications that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy.</p>
