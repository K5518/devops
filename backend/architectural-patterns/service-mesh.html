<p>A service mesh is an architectural pattern for enhancing communication, security, and management between microservices in a distributed network. It employs a collection of intelligent proxies to manage service-to-service communication, ensuring high availability, efficient load balancing, and robust service discovery. Additionally, a service mesh offers advanced features like observability for monitoring network behavior, and various traffic management capabilities.</p>
<p>In a typical service mesh setup, each microservice is paired with a proxy. This proxy, often deployed using a sidecar pattern, is responsible not only for handling communication to and from its associated microservice but also for implementing various network functionalities. These functionalities include load balancing, intelligent routing, and ensuring secure data transfer.</p>
<p>The sidecar pattern, integral to service meshes, involves deploying the proxy as a sidecar container alongside the main microservice container, especially in Kubernetes environments. This design allows the service mesh to function independently from the microservices themselves, simplifying management and updates.</p>
<p>Popular service mesh implementations include Istio and Linkerd, which offer robust solutions tailored to modern, cloud-based application architectures.</p>
