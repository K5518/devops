<p>Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain’s experts.</p>
<p>In terms of object-oriented programming, it means that the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.</p>
<p>DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model and it is predicated on the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing the project’s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;</li>
<li>Basing complex designs on a model of the domain;</li>
<li>Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.</li>
</ul>
