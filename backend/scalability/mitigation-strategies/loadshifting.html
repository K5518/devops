<p>Load shifting is a design pattern that is used to manage the workload of a system by shifting the load to different components or resources at different times. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to balance the workload of a system and to optimize the use of resources.</p>
<p>There are several ways to implement load shifting in a cloud environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling: This involves scheduling the execution of tasks or workloads to occur at specific times or intervals.</li>
<li>Load balancing: This involves distributing the workload of a system across multiple resources, such as servers or containers, to ensure that the workload is balanced and that resources are used efficiently.</li>
<li>Auto-scaling: This involves automatically adjusting the number of resources that are available to a system based on the workload, allowing the system to scale up or down as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Load shifting is an important aspect of cloud design, as it helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that the system remains stable and available. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as throttling and backpressure, to provide a scalable and resilient cloud environment.</p>
