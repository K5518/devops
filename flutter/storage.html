<p>Flutter provides several options for persistent storage, some of which are as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>SharedPreferences: A key-value store for small data.</li>
<li>SQLite database: A relational database for structured data.</li>
<li>File System: For storing large files and data.</li>
<li>Firebase: A real-time database and backend as a service.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these storage options are supported through third-party packages, which are easily integrated into a Flutter app.</p>
