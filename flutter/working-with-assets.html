<p>Assets are resources such as images, fonts, and other files that are included in your app. To use assets in Flutter, you need to specify them in your app’s <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file and then access them in your code.</p>

<p>The <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file is used to manage dependencies, assets, and other settings in your Flutter app. The <code>flutter</code> section is used to specify assets that should be included with the app. The path specified in the <code>assets</code> section should be relative to the <code>pubspec.yaml</code> file.</p>
