<p>Lambdas, also known as anonymous functions, are a fundamental concept in Dart and Flutter. They are a way to create short, inline functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.</p>
<p>Here are some common use cases for lambdas in Dart Flutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event Handlers: You can use lambdas as event handlers for widgets, such as buttons.</li>
<li>Callbacks: You can use lambdas as callbacks to pass into functions that execute later.</li>
<li>Streams: You can use lambdas to handle events in a Stream.</li>
<li>Filtering: You can use lambdas to filter data in a collection using functions like where and <code>firstWhere</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lambdas are defined using the <code>=></code> operator and can take zero or more arguments. They can also contain expressions, statements, and return values.</p>
