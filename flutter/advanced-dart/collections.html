<h1 id="collections">Collections</h1>
<p>In Dart, collections are used to store and manipulate groups of objects. There are several types of collections available, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>List (ordered and indexable)</li>
<li>Set (unordered and unique elements)</li>
<li>Map (key-value pairs)</li>
<li>Queue (ordered and first-in-first-out)</li>
<li>Stack (ordered and last-in-first-out)</li>
</ol>
<p>These collections are built-in data structures that can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently. They can be used in a variety of scenarios, such as storing user data, managing state, and organizing algorithms.</p>
