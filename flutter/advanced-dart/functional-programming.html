<h1 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h1>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, statelessness, and the use of functions to transform data. Dart, being a modern programming language, supports functional programming concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher-Order Functions: Dart supports functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output.</li>
<li>Immutable Data: Dart provides support for immutable data structures and encourages the use of these data structures in functional programming.</li>
<li>Lambdas/Closures: Dart has support for anonymous functions, also known as lambdas or closures, which can be used to create simple and concise functions.</li>
<li>Pure Functions: Dart encourages the use of pure functions, which are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output given the same inputs.</li>
</ul>
