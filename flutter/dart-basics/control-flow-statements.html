<p>In Dart, control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program. The following are the main types of control flow statements in Dart:</p>
<ul>
<li>if-else: used to conditionally execute code based on a boolean expression.</li>
<li>for loop: used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
<li>while loop: used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition is true.</li>
<li>do-while loop: similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated.</li>
<li>switch-case: used to select one of several code blocks to execute based on a value.</li>
<li>break: used to exit a loop early.</li>
<li>continue: used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next one.</li>
</ul>
<p>These control flow statements can be used to create complex logic and control the flow of execution in Dart programs.</p>
