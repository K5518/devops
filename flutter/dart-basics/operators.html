<h1 id="operators">Operators</h1>
<p>Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values. There are several types of operators available in Flutter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arithmetic operators: used to perform mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and more.</li>
<li>Relational operators: used to compare values and return a boolean result (==, !=, >, &#x3C;, >=, &#x3C;=).</li>
<li>Logical operators: used to perform logical operations like AND (&#x26;&#x26;), OR (||), and NOT (!).</li>
<li>Assignment operators: used to assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).</li>
<li>Ternary operator: a shorthand way of writing simple if-else statements (condition ? if_true : if_false).</li>
</ul>
<p>These operators can be used to perform operations on values, variables, and expressions in Flutter.</p>
