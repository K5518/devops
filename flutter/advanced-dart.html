<h1 id="advanced-dart">Advanced Dart</h1>
<p>Here are some advanced concepts in Dart that are commonly used in Flutter development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generics: allows creating reusable code by abstracting over types</li>
<li>Async/Await: simplifies asynchronous programming by allowing to wait for a Future to complete in a clean, readable way.</li>
<li>Mixins: lets classes inherit behaviors from multiple mixin classes</li>
<li>Abstract Classes: provide a base class that can be extended to create multiple concrete implementations.</li>
<li>Streams: provide a way to receive a continuous sequence of events, like data from a server or user events.</li>
<li>Isolates: allow running Dart code in separate threads with communication through message passing.</li>
<li>Futures: represent a value that will be available at some point in the future.</li>
<li>Null-aware operators (??, ?.): provide a concise way to handle null values.</li>
<li>Collection literals: provide concise syntax for creating collections.</li>
<li>Extension Methods: allow adding methods to existing classes, even if you don’t have access to their source code.</li>
</ul>
<p>By mastering these concepts, you will be able to write more efficient and maintainable Dart code in your Flutter projects.</p>
