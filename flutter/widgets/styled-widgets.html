<h1 id="styled-widgets">Styled Widgets</h1>
<p>Styled Widgets are Flutter widgets that are decorated with custom styles, such as colors, fonts, and shapes. They can be created by wrapping existing widgets with other widgets, such as Container, Theme, or BoxDecoration. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Container widget can be used to set a fixed width, height, padding, and margin.</li>
<li>Theme widget can be used to specify a color scheme and typography for an entire app or a section of it.</li>
<li>BoxDecoration can be used to add a border, background color, and a border radius to a widget.</li>
<li>Styled Widgets allow developers to easily customize the look and feel of their Flutter app and create a consistent visual style.</li>
</ul>
