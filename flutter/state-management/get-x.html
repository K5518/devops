<h1 id="getx">GetX</h1>
<p>GetX is a lightweight and powerful solution for state management and navigation in Flutter. It provides a clean and simple API for managing app state and navigating between screens. GetX makes it easy to create scalable and maintainable apps, as it offers a central place to manage the app’s state, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed. It also provides out-of-the-box support for routing, making it easy to navigate between screens, and it supports hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes in real-time.</p>
