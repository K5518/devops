<p>GitHub Actions is a workflow automation tool provided by GitHub that can be used to automate various tasks in a Flutter mobile app development process.</p>
<p>With GitHub Actions, developers can create custom workflows to automate tasks such as building the app, running tests, and deploying the app to various app stores. These workflows are defined as a series of actions in a YAML file, which can be committed to the repository.</p>
<p>In a Flutter project, GitHub Actions can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automate the build process</li>
<li>Run tests</li>
<li>Deploy to multiple app stores</li>
<li>Monitor the build process</li>
</ul>
