<h1 id="structural-typing">Structural Typing</h1>
<p>Type compatibility in TypeScript is based on structural subtyping. <code>Structural typing</code> is a way of relating types based solely on their members. This is in contrast with nominal typing.</p>
<p>TypeScript’s structural type system was designed based on how JavaScript code is typically written. Because JavaScript widely uses anonymous objects like function expressions and object literals, it’s much more natural to represent the relationships found in JavaScript libraries with a structural type system instead of a nominal one.</p>
