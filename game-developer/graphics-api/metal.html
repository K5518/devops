<p>Metal is a low-level, high-performance, application programming interface (API) developed by Apple. It debuted in iOS 8 and is dedicated to graphics and data-parallel computations. Essentially, it’s designed to exploit modern GPU architecture on Apple devices, optimizing performance and power efficiency. This API applies to various platforms, including iOS, macOS, and tvOS. In contrast to high-level APIs like OpenGL, Metal offers a much lower overhead, allowing more direct control over the GPU. For developers, it means that they can squeeze better performance out of the hardware compared to higher-level APIs. With Metal, developers have a much more detailed view and control on the GPU which results in better graphical output and smoother performance.</p>
