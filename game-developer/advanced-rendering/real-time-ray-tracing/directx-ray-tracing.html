<p>DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) is an advanced Windows API introduced with DirectX 12. It delivers real-time, cinema-quality rendering to contend development in gaming and professional visualization. It provides highly efficient and straightforward access to RT Core hardware. DXR adds four new concepts to DirectX 12: The acceleration structure, The Raytracing pipeline state object, Shader tables, and the Command list method (DispatchRays). It represents a significant step forward by Microsoft in embracing Ray Tracing as a new standard in real-time rendering pipelines. For developers, DirectX Ray tracing is straightforward to integrate into existing engines given its easy compatibility with existing DirectX 12 programming models. However, to truly maximize DXR’s potential, a deep understanding of both graphics workloads and tracing algorithms is necessary.</p>
