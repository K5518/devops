<h1 id="flux-cd">Flux CD</h1>
<p>Flux CD is a continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that is based on the GitOps methodology. It is used to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications by continuously synchronizing the desired application state with the actual application state in the production environment.</p>
<p>In a Flux CD workflow, changes to the application are made by committing code or configuration changes to a Git repository. Flux CD monitors the repository and automatically deploys the changes to the production environment using a continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline is triggered by changes to the Git repository and is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the changes to the production environment.</p>
<p>Flux CD is designed to be a simple and efficient way to manage cloud-native applications, as it allows developers to make changes to the system using familiar tools and processes and it provides a clear and auditable history of all changes to the system. It is often used in conjunction with tools such as Helm to automate the deployment and management of cloud-native applications.</p>
