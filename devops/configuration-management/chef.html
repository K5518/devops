<p>Emerging in 2009, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Chef" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chef</a> (now known as Progress Chef) is one of the earliest configuration management tools to gain popularity. Chef “Recipes” are written in Ruby, in a primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">declarative</a> style.</p>
<p>Chef requires that a client is installed on a server being managed. This client polls a Chef-Server regularly, to determine what its configuration should be. Chef-Solo is also available, a version of Chef that allows provisioning of a single node by running chef locally.</p>
<p>A key tenet of Chef recipe design is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">idempotence</a>. All Chef recipes should be runnable multiple times and produce the same result - this is especially necessary in cases where the client/server model listed above is in use. This pattern of configuration management is highly influential for future declarative tools like Terraform and Cloud Formation.</p>
