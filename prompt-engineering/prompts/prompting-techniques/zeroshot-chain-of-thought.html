<p>Zeroshot chain of thought is a prompting technique that encourages models to provide multi-step reasoning or follow a series of interconnected thoughts in order to tackle a given problem. This technique is particularly effective in tasks where the answer requires a reasoning process or depends on chaining several intermediate ideas together.</p>
<p>How to implement a zeroshot chain of thought prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by defining a clear initial question or problem that will serve as the starting point for the chain.</li>
<li>Craft a prompt that not only asks the model to provide an answer to the initial question, but also requests that the model explain its reasoning step by step.</li>
<li>Encourage the model to consider intermediate steps, possible alternatives, or connections between ideas explicitly in its response.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Suppose you want the model to explain how a solar panel works. A zeroshot chain of thought prompt could look like this:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Please explain the process of how a solar panel works, starting with sunlight hitting the panel's surface and ending with electricity being produced. Structure your response as a step-by-step chain of thought, taking care to clarify how each step leads to the next.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>By designing prompts that explicitly request step-by-step reasoning, the zeroshot chain of thought technique can lead to more comprehensive and insightful answers that go beyond simple factual statements.</p>
