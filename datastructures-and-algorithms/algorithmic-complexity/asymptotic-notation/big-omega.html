<p>The Big Omega (Ω) notation is used in computer science to describe an algorithm’s lower bound. Essentially, it provides a worst-case analysis of an algorithm’s efficiency, giving us a lower limit of the performance. If we say a function f(n) is Ω(g(n)), it means that from a certain point onwards (n0 for some constant n0), the value of g(n) is a lower bound on f(n). It implies that f(n) is at least as fast as g(n) past a certain threshold. This means that the algorithm won’t perform more efficiently than the Ω time complexity suggests.</p>
