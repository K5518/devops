<p>Queues are a type of data structure in which elements are held in a sequence and access is restricted to one end. Elements are added (“enqueued”) at the rear end and removed (“dequeued”) from the front. This makes queues a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. This type of organization is particularly useful for specific situations such as printing jobs, handling requests in a web server, scheduling tasks in a system, etc. Due to its FIFO property, once a new element is inserted into the queue, all elements that were inserted before the new element must be removed before the new element can be invoked. The fundamental operations associated with queues include Enqueue (insert), Dequeue (remove) and Peek (get the top element).</p>
