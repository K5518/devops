<p>Transactions are a fundamental concept in PostgreSQL, as well as in most other database management systems. A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. Transactions help ensure that the database remains in a consistent state even when there are multiple users or operations occurring concurrently.</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-transactions">Properties of Transactions</h2>
<p>Transactions in PostgreSQL follow the ACID properties, which are an essential aspect of database systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A</strong>tomicity: A transaction should either be fully completed, or it should have no effect at all. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back, and none of the changes made during the transaction should be permanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C</strong>onsistency: The database should always be in a consistent state before and after a transaction. This means that any constraints or rules defined in the database should be satisfied before a transaction begins and after it has been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I</strong>solation: Transactions should be isolated from each other. The effect of one transaction should not be visible to another until the transaction has been committed. This helps prevent conflicts and issues when multiple transactions are trying to modify the same data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>D</strong>urability: Once a transaction has been committed, its changes should be permanent. The database should maintain a log of committed transactions so that the system can recover the committed state in case of a failure or crash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="transaction-control-statements">Transaction Control Statements</h2>
<p>In PostgreSQL, you can use the following transaction control statements to manage transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>BEGIN</code>: Starts a new transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>COMMIT</code>: Ends the current transaction and makes all changes made during the transaction permanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ROLLBACK</code>: Reverts all changes made during the current transaction and ends the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>SAVEPOINT</code>: Creates a savepoint to which you can later roll back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ROLLBACK TO savepoint</code>: Rolls back the transaction to the specified savepoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>RELEASE savepoint</code>: Releases a savepoint, which allows you to commit changes made since the savepoint.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-usage">Example Usage</h2>
<p>Here’s an example to illustrate the use of transactions:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">BEGIN</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; </span><span style="color:#6272A4">-- Start a transaction</span></span>

<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">INSERT INTO</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> employees (</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">name</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, salary) </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">VALUES</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> (</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">Alice</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, </span><span style="color:#BD93F9">5000</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">);</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">INSERT INTO</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> employees (</span><span style="color:#FF79C6">name</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, salary) </span><span style="color:#FF79C6">VALUES</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2"> (</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C">Bob</span><span style="color:#E9F284">'</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">, </span><span style="color:#BD93F9">6000</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">);</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">-- Other SQL statements...</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">COMMIT</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; </span><span style="color:#6272A4">-- Commit the transaction and make changes permanent</span></span>
<span class="line"></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#6272A4">-- In case of an issue, you can use ROLLBACK to revert changes</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#FF79C6">ROLLBACK</span><span style="color:#F8F8F2">; </span><span style="color:#6272A4">-- Roll back the transaction and undo all changes</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>In conclusion, transactions are an essential feature in PostgreSQL when working with multiple users or operations that modify the database. By using transactions, you can ensure data consistency, prevent conflicts, and manage database changes effectively.</p>
