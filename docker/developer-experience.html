<h1 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h1>
<p>So far we have only discussed using docker for deploying applications. However, docker is also a great tool for developing applications. There are a few different recommendations that you can adopt to improve your development experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>docker-compose</code> in your application for ease of development.</li>
<li>Use bind mounts to mount the code from your local into the container filesystem to avoid having to rebuild the container image with every single change.</li>
<li>For auto-reloading, you can use tools like <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">vite</a> for client side, <a href="https://nodemon.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">nodemon</a> for nodejs or <a href="https://github.com/cosmtrek/air" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">air</a> for golang.</li>
<li>You should also provide a way to debug your applications. For example, look into <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">delve</a> for Go, enable debugging in node.js using —inspect flag etc. It doesn’t matter what you use, but the point is that you should have a way to debug your application running inside the container.</li>
<li>You should have a way to run tests inside the container. For example, you could have a separate docker-compose file for running tests.</li>
<li>You should have a CI pipeline for production images.</li>
<li>Ephemeral environment for each pull request</li>
</ul>
