<p>Docker images can include command line utilities or standalone applications that we can run inside containers. This can be really useful when working with third-party images, as the tools we want to use are already packaged and available to be run without any installation or configuration.</p>
<h3 id="busybox">BusyBox</h3>
<p>BusyBox is a small (1-2 Mb) and simple command line application that provides a large number of the commonly used Unix utilities, such as <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>vi</code>, etc. To run BusyBox inside a Docker container, you simply need to pull the image and run it with Docker:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">docker</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> pull</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> busybox</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">docker</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> run</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> -it</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> busybox</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> /bin/sh</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>Once inside the container, you can start running various BusyBox utilities just like you would on a regular command line.</p>
<h3 id="curl">cURL</h3>
<p>cURL is a well-known command line tool that can be used to transfer data using various network protocols. It is often used for testing APIs or downloading files from the internet. To use cURL inside a Docker container, you can use the official cURL image available on Docker Hub:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">docker</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> pull</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> curlimages/curl</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#50FA7B">docker</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> run</span><span style="color:#BD93F9"> --rm</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> curlimages/curl</span><span style="color:#F1FA8C"> https://example.com</span></span>
<span class="line"></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>--rm</code> flag is used to remove the container after the command has finished running. This is useful when you only need to run a single command and then clean up the container afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="other-command-line-utilities">Other Command Line Utilities</h3>
<p>There are numerous command line utilities available in Docker images, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wget</code>: A free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.</li>
<li><code>imagemagick</code>: A powerful software suite for image manipulation and conversion.</li>
<li><code>jq</code>: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use any of these tools, you can search for them on Docker Hub and follow the instructions provided in their respective repositories.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using third-party Docker images for command line utilities can save time, simplify your development setup, and help ensure a consistent environment across different machines. You can experiment with different utilities and tools as you expand your knowledge and use of Docker.</p>
