<p>Understanding the core technologies that power Docker will provide you with a deeper insight into how Docker works and will help you use the platform more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="linux-containers-lxc">Linux Containers (LXC)</h2>
<p>Linux Containers (LXC) serve as the foundation for Docker. LXC is a lightweight virtualization solution that allows multiple isolated Linux systems to run on a single host without the need for a full-fledged hypervisor. LXC effectively isolates applications and their dependencies in a secure and optimized manner.</p>
<h2 id="control-groups-cgroups">Control Groups (cgroups)</h2>
<p>Control Groups (cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation and management of resources like CPU, memory, and I/O to a set of processes. Docker leverages cgroups to limit the resources used by containers and ensure that one container does not monopolize the resources of the host system.</p>
<h2 id="union-file-systems-unionfs">Union File Systems (UnionFS)</h2>
<p>UnionFS is a file system service that allows the overlaying of multiple file systems in a single, unified view. Docker uses UnionFS to create a layered approach for images and containers, which enables better sharing of common files and faster container creation.</p>
<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>
<p>Namespaces are another Linux kernel feature that provides process isolation. They allow Docker to create isolated workspaces called containers. Namespaces ensure that processes within a container cannot interfere with processes outside the container or on the host system. There are several types of namespaces, like PID, NET, MNT, and USER, each responsible for isolating a different aspect of a process.</p>
