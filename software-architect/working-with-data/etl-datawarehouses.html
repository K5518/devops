<p>In the world of data warehousing, if you need to bring data from multiple different data sources into one, centralized database, you must first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EXTRACT</strong> data from its original source</li>
<li><strong>TRANSFORM</strong> data by deduplicating it, combining it, and ensuring quality, to then</li>
<li><strong>LOAD</strong> data into the target database</li>
</ul>
<p>ETL tools enable data integration strategies by allowing companies to gather data from multiple data sources and consolidate it into a single, centralized location. ETL tools also make it possible for different types of data to work together.</p>
