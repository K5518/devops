<h1 id="reactive-and-functional-programming">Reactive and Functional programming</h1>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle pure mathematical functions. This paradigm is totally focused on writing more compounded and pure functions.</p>
<p>Reactive programming describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time updates to otherwise static content. It provides an efficient means — the use of automated data streams — to handle data updates to content whenever a user makes an inquiry.</p>
