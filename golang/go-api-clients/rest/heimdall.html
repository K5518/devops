<p>Heimdall is an HTTP client that helps your application make a large number of requests, at scale. With Heimdall, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a hystrix-like circuit breaker to control failing requests</li>
<li>Add synchronous in-memory retries to each request, with the option of setting your own retrier strategy</li>
<li>Create clients with different timeouts for every request</li>
</ul>
<p>All HTTP methods are exposed as a fluent interface.</p>
