<h1 id="high-order-components">High Order Components</h1>
<p>A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.</p>
<p>Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.</p>
<p>Higher-order components are not commonly used in modern React code. In order to reuse logic, React hooks are mainly used now.</p>
