<p>React components have a lifecycle consisting of three phases: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting along with several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this <a href="https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lifecycle diagram</a> as a cheat sheet.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to use lifecycle methods manually. Instead, use the useEffect hook with functional components.</p>
