<h1 id="state-management">State Management</h1>
<p>Application state management is the process of maintaining knowledge of an application’s inputs across multiple related data flows that form a complete business transaction — or a session — to understand the condition of the app at any given moment. In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of an application according to its stored inputs — saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.</p>
