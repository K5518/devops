<p>SWR is a React Hooks library for data fetching.</p>
<p>The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.</p>
<p>With just one hook, you can significantly simplify the data fetching logic in your project.</p>
