<h1 id="application-caching">Application Caching</h1>
<p>In-memory caches such as Memcached and Redis are key-value stores between your application and your data storage. Since the data is held in RAM, it is much faster than typical databases where data is stored on disk. RAM is more limited than disk, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">cache invalidation</a> algorithms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">least recently used (LRU)</a> can help invalidate ‘cold’ entries and keep ‘hot’ data in RAM.</p>
<p>Redis has the following additional features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistence option</li>
<li>Built-in data structures such as sorted sets and lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, you should try to avoid file-based caching, as it makes cloning and auto-scaling more difficult.</p>
