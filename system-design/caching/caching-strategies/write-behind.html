<p>In write-behind, the application does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add/update entry in cache</li>
<li>Asynchronously write entry to the data store, improving write performance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-write-behind">Disadvantages of write-behind:</h2>
<ul>
<li>There could be data loss if the cache goes down prior to its contents hitting the data store.</li>
<li>It is more complex to implement write-behind than it is to implement cache-aside or write-through.</li>
</ul>
