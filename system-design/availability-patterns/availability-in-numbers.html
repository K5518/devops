<h1 id="availability-in-numbers">Availability in Numbers</h1>
<p>Availability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available. Availability is generally measured in number of 9s—a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.</p>

<h2 id="availability-in-parallel-vs-in-sequence">Availability in parallel vs in sequence</h2>
<p>If a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service’s overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel.</p>
<h3 id="in-sequence">In sequence</h3>
<p>Overall availability decreases when two components with availability &#x3C; 100% are in sequence:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" lang="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Availability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If both <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.</p>
<h3 id="in-parallel">In parallel</h3>
<p>Overall availability increases when two components with availability &#x3C; 100% are in parallel:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" lang="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>Availability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))</span></span></code></pre>
<p>If both <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.</p>
