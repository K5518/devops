<p>Message queues receive, hold, and deliver messages. If an operation is too slow to perform inline, you can use a message queue with the following workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application publishes a job to the queue, then notifies the user of job status</li>
<li>A worker picks up the job from the queue, processes it, then signals the job is complete</li>
</ul>
<p>The user is not blocked and the job is processed in the background. During this time, the client might optionally do a small amount of processing to make it seem like the task has completed. For example, if posting a tweet, the tweet could be instantly posted to your timeline, but it could take some time before your tweet is actually delivered to all of your followers.</p>
