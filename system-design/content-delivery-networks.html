<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon’s CloudFront support dynamic content. The site’s DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.</p>
<p>Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users receive content from data centers close to them</li>
<li>Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills</li>
</ul>
