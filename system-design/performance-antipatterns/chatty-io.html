<p>The cumulative effect of a large number of I/O requests can have a significant impact on performance and responsiveness.</p>
<p>Network calls and other I/O operations are inherently slow compared to compute tasks. Each I/O request typically has significant overhead, and the cumulative effect of numerous I/O operations can slow down the system. Here are some common causes of chatty I/O.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading and writing individual records to a database as distinct requests</li>
<li>Implementing a single logical operation as a series of HTTP requests</li>
<li>Reading and writing to a file on disk</li>
</ul>
