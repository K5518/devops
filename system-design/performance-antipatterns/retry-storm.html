<h1 id="retry-storm">Retry Storm</h1>
<p>Retry Storm refers to a situation in which a large number of retries are triggered in a short period of time, leading to a significant increase in traffic and resource usage. This can occur when a system is not properly designed to handle failures or when a component is behaving unexpectedly. This can lead to Performance degradation, Increased resource utilization, Increased network traffic, and Poor user experience. To address retry storms, a number of approaches can be taken such as Exponential backoff, Circuit breaking, and Monitoring and alerting.</p>
