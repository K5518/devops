<p>HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server. It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request. HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.</p>
<p>A basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint). Below are common HTTP verbs:</p>
