<p>Usage monitoring tracks how the features and components of an application are used. An operator can use the gathered data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine which features are heavily used and determine any potential hotspots in the system. High-traffic elements might benefit from functional partitioning or even replication to spread the load more evenly. An operator can also use this information to ascertain which features are infrequently used and are possible candidates for retirement or replacement in a future version of the system.</li>
<li>Obtain information about the operational events of the system under normal use. For example, in an e-commerce site, you can record the statistical information about the number of transactions and the volume of customers that are responsible for them. This information can be used for capacity planning as the number of customers grows.</li>
<li>Detect (possibly indirectly) user satisfaction with the performance or functionality of the system. For example, if a large number of customers in an e-commerce system regularly abandon their shopping carts, this might be due to a problem with the checkout functionality.</li>
<li>Generate billing information. A commercial application or multitenant service might charge customers for the resources that they use.</li>
<li>Enforce quotas. If a user in a multitenant system exceeds their paid quota of processing time or resource usage during a specified period, their access can be limited or processing can be throttled.</li>
