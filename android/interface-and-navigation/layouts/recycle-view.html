<p>The <code>RecyclerView</code> is an enhanced version of the <code>ListView</code> and the <code>GridView</code>. It is a more advanced and flexible version of <code>ListView</code>. In <code>RecyclerView</code>, there are several different components that work together to display your data. The <code>RecyclerView.Adapter</code> is similar to the <code>BaseAdapter</code>; it takes data and turns it into views that can be inserted in the <code>RecyclerView</code> layout. On the other hand, the <code>RecyclerView.LayoutManager</code> helps positioning items inside the <code>RecyclerView</code> and determining the behavior when scrolling. A third significant component is <code>RecyclerView.ViewHolder</code>. It provides references to the views for each data item which help to reduce unnecessary calls to <code>findViewById()</code>. It’s also important to mention that the <code>RecyclerView</code> class supports not only lists but also a custom implementation of horizontal or vertical lists, grids, or staggered grids while offering more opportunities for fantastic custom animations.</p>
