<p>The “Hello World” app is a simple project that you can build when you’re getting started with Android development. It’s often the first program that beginners learn to build in a new system. It’s usually considered the simplest form of program that displays a message to the user - “Hello, World!” In Android, this involves creating a new project from the Android Studio and setting up the main activity. The main activity file is primarily written in Java or Kotlin where you can code for the display message, while the layout design view can be created in the XML file.</p>
