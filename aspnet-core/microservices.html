<p>Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a set of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. These services are typically built using different technologies and run in their own processes, and can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET, microservices can be built using the .NET Core framework, which is a cross-platform, open-source version of the .NET framework that can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Each microservice can be built as a self-contained, small web application that handles a specific set of functionality, such as user management, product catalog, or order processing.</p>
