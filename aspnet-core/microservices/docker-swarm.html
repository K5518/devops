<p>Docker Swarm is a container orchestration platform for managing and scheduling Docker containers across a cluster of servers. It is a native clustering solution for Docker and provides the ability to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes as a single virtual host.</p>
<p>With Docker Swarm, you can easily deploy and scale your applications across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and rolling updates, making it easy to manage and maintain your containerized applications.</p>
