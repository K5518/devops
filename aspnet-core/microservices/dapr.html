<p>Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) is an open-source, portable runtime that makes it easy to build microservices-based applications that run on the cloud and edge. It provides a set of building blocks for building microservices, including service discovery, state management, pub-sub messaging, and more. It is designed to be language-agnostic, so it can be used with any programming language, including .NET.</p>
