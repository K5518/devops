<p>Orleans is an open-source virtual actor model framework for building distributed, high-scale, and low-latency applications in .NET. It is designed to make it easy to build and operate large-scale, distributed systems, such as cloud services, IoT applications, and gaming servers.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Orleans is its use of the virtual actor model, which is a programming model that allows developers to write concurrent and parallel code in a way that is similar to writing single-threaded code. Orleans provides a set of abstractions for building stateful actors, which are similar to objects in object-oriented programming, that can be distributed across multiple machines. These actors can communicate with each other using message passing, and can be accessed remotely using a transparent proxy</p>
