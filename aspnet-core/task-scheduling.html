<h1 id="task-scheduling">Task Scheduling</h1>
<p>Task scheduling in ASP.NET refers to the process of scheduling and executing background tasks in an application. This can include tasks such as sending emails, processing data, generating reports, or performing maintenance tasks.</p>
<p>In ASP.NET, task scheduling can be implemented using a variety of libraries and frameworks such as Quartz.NET, Hangfire, Coravel and Microsoft’s built-in IHostedService interface. These libraries and frameworks provide a way to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals, and also provide APIs for managing and monitoring the progress of scheduled tasks.</p>
