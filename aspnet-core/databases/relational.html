<p>A relational database is a type of database that stores data in a structured format, using tables and relationships between them. It is based on the relational model, which organizes data into one or more tables, with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns.</p>
<p>The main feature of a relational database is the ability to establish relationships between tables, using a feature called a foreign key. A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that is used to link to the primary key of another table. This allows data to be spread across multiple tables, but still be connected and easily accessed through these relationships.</p>
