<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed, open-source search and analytics engine that can be used to index, search, and analyze large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time. It is built on top of the Apache Lucene library and can be used to perform full-text search, faceted search, and geospatial search, among other things.</p>
<p>In an ASP.NET application, Elasticsearch can be integrated as a search engine to provide advanced search functionality to the application. There are several libraries available for integrating Elasticsearch with an ASP.NET application, such as Nest and Elasticsearch.Net. These libraries provide a .NET client for Elasticsearch, which can be used to interact with the Elasticsearch engine from within an ASP.NET application.
