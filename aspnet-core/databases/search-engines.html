<p>A search engine in an ASP.NET application is a tool or module that allows users to search for and retrieve specific information from the application’s database or other data sources. Search engines can be used to perform full-text search, faceted search, and geospatial search, among other things.</p>
<p>Search engines can be integrated into an ASP.NET application by using libraries or frameworks that provide a .NET client for interacting with the search engine. Some popular search engines that can be integrated with an ASP.NET application include Elasticsearch, Apache Solr, Sphinx, and Microsoft Azure Search.</p>
