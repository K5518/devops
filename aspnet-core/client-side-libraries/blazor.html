<p>Blazor is a framework for building web applications using C# and .NET that runs in the browser via WebAssembly. It allows developers to write C# code that runs directly in the browser, eliminating the need for JavaScript.</p>
<p>Blazor comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blazor WebAssembly, a client-side solution that allows you to run C# code directly in the browser using WebAssembly. The app is executed on the client-side and can work offline, it can also interact with JavaScript and access the browser’s DOM.</li>
<li>Blazor Server, a server-side solution that allows you to run C# code on the server and update the UI in real-time. The app is executed on the server-side and requires an active connection to the server to function.</li>
</ul>
