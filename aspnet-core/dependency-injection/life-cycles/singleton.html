<p>Singleton lifetime is a type of dependency injection that creates a single instance of an object and reuses it throughout the lifetime of the application. This means that if multiple components within the same request or across different requests depend on the same service, they will all receive the same instance of the service.</p>
<p>Singleton lifetime is useful when you have services that need to maintain state or shared data across requests, such as a service that caches data or maintains a connection to a resource.</p>
