<p>Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. It is a lightweight, cross-platform version of Entity Framework, the ORM framework that was part of the .NET Framework. EF Core allows developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects, eliminating the need to write raw SQL statements. Instead, EF Core provides a set of APIs that can be used to interact with a database, providing a simple and efficient way to perform common database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.</p>
