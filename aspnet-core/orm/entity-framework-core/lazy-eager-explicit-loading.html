<h2 id="eager-loading">Eager Loading</h2>
<p>Eager Loading helps you to load all your needed entities at once; i.e., all your child entities will be loaded at single database call. This can be achieved, using the Include method, which returns the related entities as a part of the query and a large amount of data is loaded at once.</p>
<h2 id="lazy-loading">Lazy Loading</h2>
<p>It is the default behavior of an Entity Framework, where a child entity is loaded only when it is accessed for the first time. It simply delays the loading of the related data, until you ask for it.</p>
