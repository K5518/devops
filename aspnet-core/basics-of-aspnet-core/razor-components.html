<p>Razor Components is a feature of ASP.NET Core that allows developers to build reusable, self-contained components that can be used across multiple pages or even multiple applications. Razor Components is built on top of the Razor view engine, which allows developers to define components using a combination of Razor markup and C# code.</p>
<p>Razor Components are useful for building complex, dynamic, and reusable UI elements, such as forms, tables, or dialogs, and can be used to build both small and large-scale web applications.</p>
