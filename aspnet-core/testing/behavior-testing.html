<p>Behavior testing, also known as Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD), is a software development methodology that focuses on the behavior of the system being developed, rather than its implementation. BDD is a variation of Test-Driven Development (TDD), which emphasizes the use of automated tests to drive the development of software. BDD frameworks such as SpecFlow, Cucumber, and LightBDD provide a set of tools for writing and executing BDD tests in the context of ASP.NET. These frameworks allow developers to write tests using a fluent API, which allows them to describe the behavior of their application in a natural language format. They also provide a set of extension methods, which can be used to add additional functionality, such as validating the output of a test, logging test results, or integrating with other testing tools.</p>
