<h1 id="e2e-testing">E2E Testing</h1>
<p>E2E testing is a method of testing the complete functionality of an application, from start to finish, it’s used to test the entire workflow of an application and ensure that all the different components and features work together seamlessly. In the context of ASP.NET, E2E testing can be used to test web applications built using the ASP.NET framework. E2E testing can be done using frameworks such as Selenium, Playwright, and Cypress which allow developers to automate browser interactions and simulate user interactions with the application. E2E testing is an important aspect of software development and it helps to identify and fix issues early in the development process and ensure that the application behaves as expected when it is released to the users.</p>
