<p><code>Reqwest</code> is a Rust library which is designed to make HTTP requests easy and effortless. It offers a mix of convenience methods for both synchronous and asynchronous requests,GET,POST and other HTTP methods. It also supports JSON content and is built on <code>hyper</code> for HTTP and <code>tokio</code> for asynchronous I/O. This means you can take advantage of the powerful asynchronous features of Rust such as Futures and async/await. Furthermore, <code>Reqwest</code> takes care of many tedious aspects of HTTP for you, such as handling cookies and encoding/decoding different formats.</p>
