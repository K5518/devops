<p><code>toml-rs</code> is a library in Rust designed to parse and serialize TOML documents. TOML, which stands for Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language, is a straightforward and easy-to-read format often used for configuration files. The <code>toml-rs</code> library provides functionalities to convert between TOML documents and Rust structures. It heavily uses Rust’s powerful trait system and type inference, to parse a TOML document into Rust’s static types for further manipulation. Moreover, by making use of the ‘serde’ library, it enables automatic serialization and deserialization between TOML and Rust types.</p>
