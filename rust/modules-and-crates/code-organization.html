<p>In Rust, the fundamental structure for organizing your code is through using a <strong>module</strong> system and <strong>crates</strong>. A module in Rust allows grouping of related function definitions and struct definitions in a named scope. It’s defined using the <code>mod</code> keyword. The modules can also be nested and make code more concise, readable, and manageable. On the other hand, a <strong>crate</strong> is a binary or a library project in Rust. It’s the largest compilation unit of Rust. It’s a tree of modules that produces a library or executable. The crate root is a source file which the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (e.g. <code>main.rs</code> or <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>
