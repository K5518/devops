<p><code>RwLock</code> in Rust stands for Read/Write lock, which is a type of synchronization primitive. It is an advanced version of the Mutex data structure. Unlike Mutex, which only allows one thread to access the data, <code>RwLock</code> allows multiple threads to read data at the same time but only one thread to write. If a thread is writing, no other thread can read or write. The syntax for declaring <code>RwLock</code> is <code>let lock = RwLock::new(value)</code>. Please remember that a potential downside of <code>RwLock</code> is lock contention, making sure to properly manage read-write access. The appropriate use of <code>RwLock</code> can enable better performance for workloads that involve heavy reading.</p>
