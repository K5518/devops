<p>Most of the browsers have built-in developer tools that help you perform web development specific tasks on a webpage. My personal recommendation would be to use Chrome DevTools as it is the most advanced and has the most features. However, if you are using a different browser, you can still use the DevTools to debug your web application.</p>
