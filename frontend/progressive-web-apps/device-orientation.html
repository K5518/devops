<p>The Device Orientation API is a web API that provides access to the device’s orientation and motion data, such as its pitch, roll, and yaw. It allows web developers to build applications that can respond to the device’s orientation and motion, such as augmented reality and motion-controlled games.</p>
<p>To use the Device Orientation API, a web page must first request permission from the user to access the device’s orientation data. If permission is granted, the page can then use the DeviceOrientationEvent object to access the device’s orientation data and respond to changes in orientation. The API provides several properties for accessing the device’s orientation and motion data, as well as events for detecting changes in orientation.</p>
<p>The Device Orientation API is supported by most modern web browsers and is often used in conjunction with other APIs, such as the Geolocation API, to build location-based applications.</p>
