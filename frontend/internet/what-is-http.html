<h1 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP?</h1>
<p>HTTP is the <code>TCP/IP</code> based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</p>
